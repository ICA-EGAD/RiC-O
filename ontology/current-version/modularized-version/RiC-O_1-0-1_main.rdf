            <html:p>RiC-O (Records in Contexts-Ontology) is an OWL ontology for describing archival
               record resources. As the third part of Records in Contexts standard, it is a formal
               representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM). This version, which
               is v1.0.1, is the latest official release. It is compliant with RiC-CM v1.0.</html:p>

            <html:div id="design-principles">
               <html:h4>RiC-O design principles</html:h4>
               <html:p>The following design principles were followed when developing RiC-O.</html:p>
               <html:p>
                  <html:strong>1. RiC-O is a domain and reference ontology</html:strong>.</html:p>
               <html:p>RiC-O provides <html:strong>a generic vocabulary and formal rules for
                     creating RDF datasets (or generating them from existing archival metadata) that
                     describe in a consistent way any kind of archival record
                  resource</html:strong>. It supports publishing RDF datasets as Linked Data,
                  querying them using SPARQL, and making inferences using the logic of the
                  ontology.</html:p>
               <html:p>While some projects have built some specific ontologies for describing
                  archives, in 2013 no generic domain ontology existed for the specific needs of the
                  archival community. This is why EGAD decided to develop RiC-O as a part of RiC
                  standard.</html:p>
               <html:p>Apart from this first, main target, <html:strong>RiC-O, as a technical
                     implementation of RiC-CM that also extends and refines it and that includes
                     formal logic, can guide or inspire, in many ways, the development of any tool
                     or system that manages (i.e. stores, enables to edit or processes) and
                     publishes descriptive archival metadata.</html:strong>. Of course, other
                  technical implementations of RiC-CM may be developed later on. Also, the current
                  technical implementations of the former ICA standards, e.g. EAD and EAC-CPF XML
                  schemas, should be made closer to RiC-CM in the future; on this topic, see <html:a href="https://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-encoded-archival-standards-ts-eas">the news and announcements of the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded Archival
                     Standards (TS-EAS) of the Society of American Archivists</html:a>.</html:p>
               <html:p>As RiC-O is a generic, domain ontology, <html:strong>it does not address by
                     itself every specific need or expectation</html:strong> that may occur in every
                  archival institution or project. It is rather <html:strong>a high level
                     framework</html:strong> and an institution or project implementing RiC-O can
                  apply only such a subset of properties as meets their needs, or extend the
                  specification according to their particular requirements, or do both.</html:p>
               <html:p>As a domain ontology, RiC-O, at this stage, does not borrow from other
                  existing ontologies (such as the cultural heritage models – IFLA-LRM and
                  CIDOC-CRM, PREMIS, or PROV-O). It should therefore be easier, for an archival
                  institution or archival project, to understand, implement and maintain RiC-O
                  within its system.</html:p>
               <html:p>Alignment with those and other models, where possible, will be undertaken in
                  a future revision cycle to support the interconnected nature of resource
                  description across the domains. This is of course essential for interconnecting
                  RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O with other datasets, or for using parts of RiC-O
                  in other contexts than the archival or records management realm.</html:p>
               <html:p>
                  <html:strong>2. RiC-O is immediately usable.</html:strong>
               </html:p>
               <html:p>
                  <html:strong>This is a key feature</html:strong>. <html:strong>Metadata
                     conforming to superseded ICA standards can be transformed to RiC-O
                     successfully</html:strong>. Converting existing archival metadata created or
                  generated in current information systems and compliant with ICA standards to
                  RDF/RiC-O is possible without losing data or structure.</html:p>
               <html:p>During the ongoing development process of RiC-O, intensive conversion
                  testing, either by hand or using scripts, was conducted on XML/EAD finding aids
                  and XML/EAC-CPF authority records to ensure that RiC-O is usable with existing
                  descriptive metadata. An <html:a href="https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter">open source
                     conversion software</html:a> was also developed and made available in April
                  2020.</html:p>
               <html:p>While some existing metadata sets may have a very fine level of granularity
                  and accuracy, already using, for example, controlled vocabularies, or describing
                  curation events separately, often these metadata don’t have the very precise
                  structure that RiC-CM recommends. Even then, such a conversion process remains
                  possible. In order to allow this, RiC-O sometimes provides several methods for
                  representing information (as described below). From this point of view, RiC-O v1.0
                  may be considered a transitional ontology, in which some components may be
                  deprecated later on.</html:p>
               <html:p>The usability of a model also depends on its documentation. RiC-O is
                  documented extensively. The documentation will be reviewed and updated on a
                  continuing basis.</html:p>
               <html:p>
                  <html:strong>3. RiC-O provides a flexible framework</html:strong>.</html:p>
               <html:p>
                  <html:strong>This is a very important principle too</html:strong>. It is related
                  with the usability principle quoted above. Moreover, <html:strong>archival
                     description is flexible by essence</html:strong>. It is quite commonly noted
                  that today the level of granularity of information varies from one finding aid to
                  another (or from one authority record to another), or even within the same finding
                  aid. Some series or agents are described summarily because little is known about
                  them and there is little time for extensive research, while other series, even
                  records, or agents are described in detail; some relations (e.g. that relating to
                  provenance) may be described without any detail while others may be thoroughly
                  documented, as ISAAR(CPF) and EAC-CPF allow it.</html:p>
               <html:p>Being generally flexible, for an OWL ontology, depends first on the
                  polyhierarchical systems of classes and properties it provides. A superproperty or
                  superclass, more general or generic than its subproperties or subclasses, must
                  exist and be available for handling information, while at the same time more
                  accurate subcomponents must be there for handling more accurate description. Also,
                  RiC-O provides methods for describing relations as full entities, as well as
                  direct and short paths between entities.</html:p>
               <html:p>
                  <html:strong>4. RiC-O opens new potential for archival description.</html:strong>
               </html:p>
               <html:p>
                  <html:strong>Linked Data tools and interfaces enable end users to go through
                     RDF/RiC-O graphs, query them using SPARQL, and make inferences. This means a
                     completely new way of consulting archival metadata and their multiple
                     contexts.</html:strong> An end user should be able to ask of any given data
                  set, for example, “What are (according to your dataset) the corporate bodies that
                  succeeded a given entity from its end of existence to now (as concerns this given
                  activity)?”, or “what instantiations of this photograph exist?”, or “what are the
                  existing copies of this original charter?”, and get a list of these entities. This
                  means that institutions or projects that invest in the implementation of RiC-O
                  will be able to query their data in ways not possible with the previous ICA
                  standards, and will get new insight into the content and context of their archives
                  that wasn’t visible with the existing ICA-standards. What is more, repositories
                  using RiC-O may infer new assertions from the RDF datasets and link them to other
                  resources outside their institution, thereby amplifying the query and inferencing
                  possibilities manifold.</html:p>
               <html:p>
                  <html:strong>5. RiC-O is extensible.</html:strong>
               </html:p>
               <html:p>Institutions with descriptive needs beyond what RiC-O provides out-of-the-box
                  have the option of extending the ontology by adding new subclasses or
                  subproperties as needed. Also, the concepts defined in existing SKOS vocabularies
                  (e.g. a list of documentary form types) can also be connected to RiC-O based
                  graphs (using the *Type classes, and properties which are in the domain or range
                  of these classes).</html:p>
               <html:p>RiC-O has also the potential to be usable in other contexts than purely
                  archival ones. It can be used to “hook” archival description to descriptive
                  metadata in other domains (e.g. bibliographic or museum metadata). As said above,
                  alignment with other models will be undertaken by EGAD in a future revision cycle,
                  facilitating such connections.</html:p>

                           RiC-O</html:strong>. These classes are organized according to the same
                        hierarchy as in RiC-CM. Some projects may need very few of them (e.g. Agent,
                        Record Resource and Activity only), while others may need more (e.g.
                        Corporate Body and Person; Record; Place; Organic Provenance
                        Relation).</html:p>
                     <html:p>
                        <html:strong>Many classes only exist in RiC-O and not in
                           RiC-CM</html:strong>. These additional classes address special
                        needs:</html:p>
                     <html:ul>
                        <html:li>
                           <html:strong>some correspond to RiC-CM attributes</html:strong>,
                           when it may be considered necessary to handle them as full entities. This
                           is the case for <html:a href="#rico:Type">Type</html:a> and its
                           subclasses, that correspond to RiC-CM attributes that contain controlled
                           values, and that can help to articulate RiC-O with external RDF resources
                           like SKOS vocabularies; and also for <html:a href="#rico:Language">Language</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:Name">Name</html:a> and
                              <html:a href="#rico:Identifier">Identifier</html:a>, that can be
                           considered as full entities and as key linking nodes in a RDF graph. All
                           these classes have been grouped under a <html:a href="#rico:Concept">Concept</html:a> class. </html:li>
                        <html:li>
                           <html:strong>some classes have been added in order to provide a
                              more accurate definition and model for some entities</html:strong>.
                              <html:a href="#rico:Place">Place</html:a> thus comes along with a
                              <html:a href="#rico:PhysicalLocation">Physical Location
                           class</html:a>, and with a <html:a href="#rico:Coordinates">Coordinates
                              class</html:a>. A Place is considered both a geographical and
                           historical entity. As a historical entity, among other features, it has a
                           history, and may be preceded or succeeded by other Places. A Place also
                           may have zero to many Physical Location through time (for instance, its
                           boundaries, if it is an administrative area or a country, may change).
                           Each Physical Location may be connected to zero to many Coordinates. This
                           model is quite close to the Linked Places Format (<html:a href="https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places">https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places</html:a>). Another
                           example of such an addition is the <html:a href="#rico:Proxy">Proxy
                              class</html:a>, that represents (stands for) a Record Resource as it
                           exists in a specific Record Set.</html:li>
                        <html:li>
                           <html:strong>finally, a system of n-ary classes helps to implement
                              the Relations section of RiC-CM</html:strong>. While these relations
                           also are represented as simple, binary object properties (e.g. <html:a href="#rico:hasOrganicProvenance">hasOrganicProvenance</html:a> that
                           corresponds to RiC-R026 relation), you may need to assign different
                           attributes to a relation, e.g. a date, certainty or description, as it is
                           already possible, and quite often done, in a XML/EAC-CPF file. One of the
                           standard available methods for representing such a documented relation in
                           RDF for now is to use a class. The RDF-star specification, which is being
                           developed by the W3C RDF-DEV Community Group, provides a far simpler
                           method (allowing to consider a triple as the subject or object of another
                           triple; see <html:a href="https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/">https://w3c.github.io/rdf-star/</html:a>) and is already being used
                           by some tools; however it is not yet a complete W3C standard. Thus, for
                           example, in RiC-O a <html:a href="#rico:OrganicProvenanceRelation">OrganicProvenanceRelation class</html:a> exists. This class may
                           connect one to many Agents to one to many created or accumulated Record
                           Resources or Instantiations, and has some specific object properties
                           (certainty, date, description, source). Back to the <html:a href="#rico:hasOrganicProvenance">hasOrganicProvenance</html:a> object
                           property, let us add that it is formally defined in RiC-O, using OWL 2
                           property chain axiom (see <html:a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F8:_Property_Chain_Inclusion">https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F8:_Property_Chain_Inclusion</html:a>),

                     <html:p>
                        <html:strong>Most of the datatype properties in RiC-O correspond to
                           RiC-CM attributes that contain free, plain text</html:strong>. See for
                        example <html:a href="#rico:generalDescription">rico:generalDescription</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:history">rico:history</html:a> and <html:a href="#scopeAndContent">rico:scopeAndContent</html:a>.</html:p>
                     <html:p>In many simple usecases it’s sufficent to just use the <html:a href="#rico:identifier">rico:identifier</html:a> or <html:a href="#rico:name">rico:name</html:a> datatype properties. However, in
                        addition to these datatype properties, the Name and Identifier RiC-CM
                        attributes also have corresponding classes (subclasses of <html:a href="#rico:Appellation">rico:Appellation</html:a>). A resource may have
                        several Identifiers (e.g. archival reference code, system number, digital
                        object identifier) or Names and each comes with different attributes; in
                        this case instances of classes are needed.</html:p>
                     <html:p>The Location RiC-CM attribute also has a <html:a href="#rico:PhysicalLocation">rico:PhysicalLocation</html:a>
                        corresponding class (for users who want to use Place, Physical Location and
                        Coordinates for handling places).</html:p>
                     <html:p>As already said too, every RiC-CM attribute that has ‘controlled value’
                        or ‘rule-based’ as a schema value, has a class as corresponding component in
                        RiC-O. <html:strong>However, for these CM attributes that correspond to a
                           RiC-O class, as it is necessary to provide an immediately usable
                           ontology, two supplementary datatype properties exist that allow not to
                           use the classes, at least for a while, if you want to implement RiC-O and
                           create RiC-O/RDF datasets from existing archival metadata without being
                           able to handle URIs for the information you have</html:strong>.</html:p>
                     <html:p>For example, you may not be able to handle and maintain URIs for some
                        controlled values you use in EAD finding aids for carrier types: maybe your
                        information system does not use a vocabulary for this, and you cannot for a
                        while consider these carrier types as full entities. Nevertheless you want
                        to produce RiC-O datasets where every piece of information is kept, and you
                        want to avoid blank nodes. If RiC-O would only provide the Carrier Type
                        class, it would be an issue for you.</html:p>
                     <html:p>So RiC-O provides a <html:a href="#rico:type">rico:type</html:a>
                        datatype property, with range rdfs:literal, which allows you to move
                        forward. For RiC-CM Coordinates attribute, you also have the <html:a href="#rico:geographicalCoordinates">rico:geographicalCoordinates</html:a> datatype property.</html:p>
                     <html:p>These datatype properties have a skos:scopeNote which says (for
                        example) "Provided for usability reasons. May be made deprecated or removed
                        later on. Use only if you don’t use Physical Location and Coordinates
                        classes with Place."</html:p>
                     <html:p>
                        <html:strong>The same key design principle (RiC-O must be immediately
                           usable) led us to define some datatype properties that would enable users
                           to use RiC-O in simple usecases where they do not want to consider dates
                           and rules as full entities</html:strong>. Thus, there of course is Date
                        and Rule classes in RiC-O (since there are Date and Rule entities in
                        RiC-CM). And <html:strong>you also have a <html:a href="#rico:date">rico:date</html:a> datatype property, which has several
                           subproperties; plus a <html:a href="#rico:ruleFollowed">rico:ruleFollowed</html:a> datatype property</html:strong>. The same
                        analysis led us to keep the <html:a href="#rico:history">rico:history</html:a> datatype property in RiC-O (same as RiC-CM history
                        attribute), while RiC-CM and RiC-O also provide the <html:a href="#rico:Event">Event</html:a> class, and using a series of Events may
                        of course be a better method, easier to query, link and display, than simply
                        using a history prose discourse. The two methods may be used in parallel
                        within the same dataset by an institution that, for example, would decide to
                        emphasize only the accession, appraisal and description events among the
                        whole history of Record Resources.</html:p>
                     <html:p>These datatype properties have the same kind of skos:scopeNote as
                        above.</html:p>
                     <html:p>Finally, <html:strong>we have introduced a few datatype properties that
                           do not correspond to any RiC-CM attribute</html:strong>.</html:p>
                     <html:p>Some are superproperties, and thus group datatype properties: <html:a href="#rico:physicalOrLogicalExtent">rico:physicalOrLogicalExtent</html:a>, with rico:carrierExtent,
                        rico:instantiationExtent and rico:recordResourceExtent as subproperties;

                     <html:p>Some are simply more specific properties: <html:a href="#rico:accrualsStatus">rico:accrualsStatus</html:a>; <html:a href="#rico:recordResourceStructure">rico:recordResourceStructure</html:a> and <html:a href="#rico:instantiationStructure">rico:instantiationStructure</html:a>,

               <html:p>A first beta version of RiC-O was developed in 2017 and used by the National
                  Archives of France for building a proof of concept (<html:a href="https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr">https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr</html:a>).</html:p>
               <html:p>EGAD continued to develop the ontology, and this process entered a very
                  active period in 2019, while RiC-CM v0.2 was being designed and edited. From
                  December 2018 to November 2019, about 65 persons that responded to a call for
                  reviewers, received successive beta versions of RiC-O and sent a few first
                  comments. While EGAD RiC-O team could not answer to each of these comments, each
                  was taken into account. RiC-O v0.1 was released on December 2019, at the same time
                  as RiC-CM v0.2 preview.</html:p>
               <html:p>The Git repository that is used for handling RiC-O was made public in March
                  2020 (see <html:a href="https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O">https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O</html:a>).</html:p>
               <html:p>In 2020, RiC-CM v0.2 preview was significantly updated: the textual
                  definitions of many entities were changed, as well as the specifications of many
                  attributes; and the IRIs of lot of relations were changed, in order to take into
                  account past situations and to adopt some simple naming rules. As a consequence,
                  RiC-O had to be updated in order to remain compliant with RiC-CM. These changes
                  could not be made before the end of 2020, when RiC-CM could be considered stable.
                  EGAD also decided to make other changes in RiC-O, among which the most important
                  are mentioned in bold in the following list.</html:p>
               <html:p>RiC-O 0.2 results from these updates and changes. It was released in February
                  2021, and is fully compliant with RiC-CM 0.2, which was released in July
                  2021.</html:p>
               <html:p>
                  <html:strong>At the end of 2022</html:strong>, while the EGAD group, as part of
                  the development of version 1.0 of RiC-CM, was working on analyzing and taking into
                  account the very numerous comments relating to RiC-CM 0.2 received, <html:strong>a
                     new active phase of development started for RiC-O. A team of no longer three,
                     but six people prepared this version.</html:strong> It was then absolutely not
                  a question of breaking with the principles and methods already used; the work was
                  a continuation of what had already been done. It was a matter of
                     <html:strong>improving what had already been done, by simplifying wherever
                     possible the specifications, by adding some properties and taking into account
                     the needs that a growing community of users was expressing</html:strong>. On
                  the other hand, it was obviously a question of <html:strong>making RiC-O 1.0
                     compliant with RiC-CM 1.0</html:strong>.</html:p>
               <html:p>As the result of this work, RiC-O 1.0.1 defines:</html:p>
               <html:ul>
                  <html:li>
                     <html:strong>105 classes</html:strong>, one less than in v0.2. As in RiC-CM
                     1.0, the modeling of dates has been modified, this led to the removal of the
                     three subclasses of <html:a href="#rico:Date">rico:Date</html:a>. It was
                     necessary to add a <html:a href="#rico:MandateType">rico:MandateType</html:a>
                     class, corresponding to the new RiC-A44 Mandate Type attribute of RiC-CM 1.0. A
                     generic <html:a href="#rico:OrganicOrFunctionalProvenanceRelation">rico:OrganicOrFunctionalProvenanceRelation</html:a> class was also
                     added.</html:li>
                  <html:li>
                     <html:strong>61 datatype properties</html:strong>, one less than in v0.2.
                     Several properties were renamed, to make the ontology compliant with RiC-CM 1.0
                     (so rico:descriptiveNote has become <html:a href="#rico:generalDescription">rico:generalDescription</html:a>, whose definition is a little different).
                     A <html:a href="#rico:length">rico:length</html:a> property was added;
                     rico:calendar and rico:dateStandard were removed. The hierarchy of <html:a href="#rico:date">rico:date</html:a> subproperties was revised. Some
                     properties were made subproperties of others (like <html:a href="#rico:scopeAndContent">rico:scopeAndContent</html:a>, now a
                     subproperty of <html:a href="#rico:generalDescription">rico:generalDescription</html:a>).</html:li>
                  <html:li>
                     <html:strong>400 object properties</html:strong>, compared to 423 in RiC-O 0.2.
                     This simple count poorly accounts for <html:strong>the significant
                        modifications that were made to the object properties of RiC-O
                        0.2</html:strong>. <html:br/>On the one hand, <html:strong>a certain number
                        of properties were added to make RiC-O compliant with RiC-CM
                        1.0</html:strong>: addition of properties whose domain or range are <html:a href="#rico:Date">rico:Date</html:a> or <html:a href="#rico:Event">rico:Event</html:a>; addition of <html:a href="#rico:hasOrHadMandateType">rico:hasOrHadMandateType</html:a> and <html:a href="#rico:isOrWasMandateTypeOf">rico:isOrWasMandateTypeOf</html:a>,
                     properties related to the new <html:a href="#rico:MandateType">rico:MandateType</html:a> class. On the other hand, <html:strong>to meet
                        the needs expressed by RiC-O users, other properties were
                        added</html:strong>: <html:a href="#rico:isAgentAssociatedWithPlace">rico:isAgentAssociatedWithPlace</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:isOrWasEmployerOf">rico:isOrWasEmployerOf</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:wasMergedInto">rico:wasMergedInto</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:wasSplitInto">rico:wasSplitInto</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:hasDeathPlace">rico:hasDeathPlace</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:hasBirthPlace">rico:hasBirthPlace</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:hasOrHadAnalogueInstantiation">rico:hasOrHadAnalogueInstantiation</html:a>, <html:a href="#rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation">rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation</html:a>, and their inverse properties.
                     <html:br/>Furthermore, <html:strong>a significant number of properties were
                        added to allow the expression of indirect relationships</html:strong>. Thus,
                     it is now possible, for instance, to specify that a <html:a href="#rico:Record">rico:Record</html:a> is included indirectly in a <html:a href="#rico:RecordSet">rico:RecordSet</html:a> such as a fonds, using
                        <html:a href="#rico:isIncludedInTransitive">rico:isIncludedInTransitive</html:a>, or to infer this relation, which is
                     the super property of the new <html:a href="#rico:isDirectlyIncludedIn">rico:isDirectlyIncludedIn</html:a> property. <html:strong>The addition of
                        such transitive properties concerned partitive (sub-properties of <html:a href="#rico:hasOrHadPart">rico:hasOrHadPart</html:a>), sequential
                        (sub-properties of <html:a href="#rico:precedesOrPreceded">rico:precedesOrPreceded</html:a>) and authority (sub-properties of
                           <html:a href="#rico:hasOrHadSubordinate">rico:hasOrHadSubordinate</html:a>) relations</html:strong>, and the
                     inverse properties. It was accompanied by the creation of properties specifying
                     past relations. <html:br/> Finally, <html:strong>in order to simplify their
                        maintenance, the n-ary Relation classes were rolified</html:strong>. 48 new
                     reflexive object properties were created to do this, such as for example
                        <html:a href="#rico:leadershipRelation_role">rico:leadershipRelation_role</html:a>; the definition of n-ary Relation
                     classes (such as <html:a href="#rico:LeadershipRelation">rico:LeadershipRelation</html:a>) was revised to introduce an equivalence
                     with these properties when they have the same source and the same target, and
                     the chain property axioms of the corresponding binary properties (such as
                        <html:a href="#rico:hasOrHadLeader">rico:hasOrHadLeader</html:a>) were
                     revised. 166 object properties, which existed in RiC-O 0.2 and were specific to
                     each of the n-ary relations, could then be deleted. A full accounting of the
                     rolification of n-ary relations may be found at <html:a href="https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/issues/67">https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/issues/67</html:a>).</html:li>
               </html:ul>
               <html:p>RiC-O 1.0.1 therefore presents itself as an ontology that is
                     <html:strong>more compact than RiC-O 0.2, while being richer, technically
                     opening up new possibilities (with transitive relations) and preserving the
                     semantics defined previously</html:strong>.</html:p>
               <html:p>Besides, an effort has been made regarding the documentation of the ontology.
                  In particular, <html:strong>the labels of each class and property (rdfs:label
                     annotations) are now available in French and Spanish as well as in
                     English</html:strong>. We would like to thank our French-speaking and
                  Spanish-speaking colleagues, members or not of the ICA/EGAD group, who contributed

                        containsTransitive) made a subproperty of hasPartTransitive. Every current
                        direct relation (e.g. directlyContains) made a subproperty of
                        hasDirectPart</html:strong>. Fixed a syntaxic bug on the ontology history
