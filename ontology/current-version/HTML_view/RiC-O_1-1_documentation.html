            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>RiC-O (Records in Contexts-Ontology) is an OWL ontology for describing archival
               record resources. As the third part of Records in Contexts standard, it is a formal
               representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM).</p>
            <p>RiC-O provides a generic vocabulary and formal rules for creating RDF datasets
               to describe any kind of archival record resource, whether natively or by transforming
               existing metadata (or generating them from existing archival metadata). It supports
               publishing RDF datasets as Linked Data, querying them using SPARQL, and making
               inferences.</p>
            <p>The current version is <strong>v1.1</strong>; <strong>it is
                  compliant with RiC-CM 1.0</strong>, which was published by EGAD on November
               30, 2023.</p>

            <h4>History note</h4>
            <p>A first beta version of RiC-O was developed in 2017 and used by the National
                  Archives of France for building a proof of concept (<a href="https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr" target="_blank">https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr</a>).</p>
            <p>EGAD continued to develop the ontology, and this process entered a very
                  active period in 2019, while RiC-CM v0.2 was being designed and edited. From
                  December 2018 to November 2019, about 65 persons that responded to a call for
                  reviewers, received successive beta versions of RiC-O and sent a few first
                  comments. While EGAD RiC-O team could not answer to each of these comments, each
                  was taken into account. RiC-O v0.1 was released on December 2019, at the same time
                  as RiC-CM v0.2 preview.</p>
            <p>The Git repository that is used for handling RiC-O was made public in March
                  2020 (see <a href="https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O" target="_blank">https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O</a>).</p>
            <p>In 2020, RiC-CM v0.2 preview was significantly updated: the textual
                  definitions of many entities were changed, as well as the specifications of many
                  attributes; and the IRIs of lot of relations were changed, in order to take into
                  account past situations and to adopt some simple naming rules. As a consequence,
                  RiC-O had to be updated in order to remain compliant with RiC-CM. These changes
                  could not be made before the end of 2020, when RiC-CM could be considered stable.
                  EGAD also decided to make other changes in RiC-O, among which the most important
                  are mentioned in bold in the following list.</p>
            <p>RiC-O 0.2 results from these updates and changes. It was released in February
                  2021, and is fully compliant with RiC-CM 0.2, which was released in July
                  2021.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>At the end of 2022</strong>, while the EGAD group, as part of
                  the development of version 1.0 of RiC-CM, was working on analyzing and taking into
                  account the very numerous comments relating to RiC-CM 0.2 received, <strong>a
                     new active phase of development started for RiC-O. A team of no longer three,
                     but six people prepared this version.</strong> It was then absolutely not
                  a question of breaking with the principles and methods already used; the work was
                  a continuation of what had already been done. It was a matter of
                     <strong>improving what had already been done, by simplifying wherever
                     possible the specifications, by adding some properties and taking into account
                     the needs that a growing community of users was expressing</strong>. On
                  the other hand, it was obviously a question of <strong>making RiC-O 1.0
                     compliant with RiC-CM 1.0</strong>.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>After the release of RiC-O 1.0 in December 2023, the development
                     team continued to improve the ontology</strong>. Bugs were fixed and a few
                  adjustments made to RiC-O documentation in v1.0.1 and 1.0.2. Then version 1.1
                  introduced, in addition to some corrections and adjustments, several significant
                  additions or modifications, the majority of which concern the rico:RecordResource
                  class and/or its subclasses.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>As the result of this work, RiC-O 1.1 defines:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li>
                  <strong>107 classes</strong>. As in RiC-CM 1.0, the modeling of dates
                     had been modified, this led to the removal of the three subclasses of <a href="#Date">rico:Date</a> in RiC-O 1.0. It was also necessary to
                     add a <a href="#MandateType">rico:MandateType</a> class,
                     corresponding to the new RiC-A44 Mandate Type attribute of RiC-CM 1.0. A
                     generic <a href="#OrganicOrFunctionalProvenanceRelation">rico:OrganicOrFunctionalProvenanceRelation</a> class was also added.
                     In RiC-O 1.1, a new <a href="#TitleType">rico:TitleType</a>
                     class was added, as well as a <a href="#StudyingAtRelation">rico:StudyingAtRelation</a> class.</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>75 datatype properties</strong>. Several properties had been
                     renamed in RiC-O 1.0, to make the ontology compliant with RiC-CM 1.0 (so
                     rico:descriptiveNote has become <a href="#generalDescription">rico:generalDescription</a>, whose definition is a little different).
                     A <a href="#length">rico:length</a> property had also been
                     added; rico:calendar and rico:dateStandard were removed. The hierarchy of
                        <a href="#date">rico:date</a> subproperties had been revised.
                     Some properties had been made subproperties of others (like <a href="#scopeAndContent">rico:scopeAndContent</a>, now a
                     subproperty of <a href="#generalDescription">rico:generalDescription</a>). Then in RiC-O 1.1, 14 datatype
                     properties were added, among which 9 are direct or indirect subproperties of
                        <a href="#date">rico:date</a>. Also, a <a href="#note">rico:note</a> datatype property was added,
                     superproperty of the already existing *note properties, with domain rico:Thing.
                     A new datatype property, <a href="#sentimentOrEmotionExpressed">rico:sentimentOrEmotionExpressed</a>, subproperty of
                     rico:scopeAndContent, was created, with domain Record or Record Part. A <a href="#recordResourceSourceOfInformation">rico:recordResourceSourceOfInformation</a> datatype property was added
                     to connect a Record Resource to a source on which its content is based. Two
                     datatype properties with domain RecordResource or Proxy (<a href="#rankInSequence">rico:rankInSequence</a> and <a href="#rankInHierarchy">rico:rankInHierarchy</a>), were added, to
                     be used in addition only (never independently) to the object properties defined
                     for representing sequences and hierarchies of record resources.</li>
               <li>
                  <strong>480 object properties</strong>, compared to 400 in RiC-O 1.0
                     and 423 in RiC-O 0.2. <br/> In RiC-O 1.0, <strong>significant
                        modifications had been made to the object properties of RiC-O
                        0.2</strong>. On the one hand, <strong>a certain number of
                        properties had been added to make RiC-O compliant with RiC-CM
                        1.0</strong>: addition of properties whose domain or range are <a href="#Date">rico:Date</a> or <a href="#Event">rico:Event</a>; addition of <a href="#hasOrHadMandateType">rico:hasOrHadMandateType</a> and <a href="#isOrWasMandateTypeOf">rico:isOrWasMandateTypeOf</a>,
                     properties related to the new <a href="#MandateType">rico:MandateType</a> class. On the other hand, <strong>to meet
                        the needs expressed by RiC-O users, other properties had been
                        added</strong>: <a href="#isAgentAssociatedWithPlace">rico:isAgentAssociatedWithPlace</a>, <a href="#isOrWasEmployerOf">rico:isOrWasEmployerOf</a>, <a href="#wasMergedInto">rico:wasMergedInto</a>, <a href="#wasSplitInto">rico:wasSplitInto</a>, <a href="#hasDeathPlace">rico:hasDeathPlace</a>, <a href="#hasBirthPlace">rico:hasBirthPlace</a>, <a href="#hasOrHadAnalogueInstantiation">rico:hasOrHadAnalogueInstantiation</a>, <a href="#hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation">rico:hasOrHadDigitalInstantiation</a>, and their inverse properties.
                     Furthermore, <strong>a significant number of properties had been added to
                        allow the expression of indirect relationships</strong>. Thus, it is
                     now possible, for instance, to specify that a <a href="#Record">rico:Record</a> is included indirectly in a <a href="#RecordSet">rico:RecordSet</a> such as a fonds, using
                        <a href="#isIncludedInTransitive">rico:isIncludedInTransitive</a>, or to infer this relation, which is
                     the super property of the new <a href="#isDirectlyIncludedIn">rico:isDirectlyIncludedIn</a> property. <strong>The addition of
                        such transitive properties concerned partitive (sub-properties of <a href="#hasOrHadPart">rico:hasOrHadPart</a>), sequential
                        (sub-properties of <a href="#precedesOrPreceded">rico:precedesOrPreceded</a>) and authority (sub-properties of
                           <a href="#hasOrHadSubordinate">rico:hasOrHadSubordinate</a>) relations</strong>, and the
                     inverse properties. It was accompanied by the creation of properties specifying
                     past relations. <br/> Finally, <strong>in order to simplify their
                        maintenance, the n-ary Relation classes had been rolified</strong>. 48
                     new object properties had been created to do this, such as for example <a href="#leadershipRelation_role">rico:leadershipRelation_role</a>;
                     the definition of n-ary Relation classes (such as <a href="#LeadershipRelation">rico:LeadershipRelation</a>) was
                     revised to introduce an equivalence with these properties when they have the
                     same source and the same target, and the property chain axioms of the
                     corresponding binary properties (such as <a href="#hasOrHadLeader">rico:hasOrHadLeader</a>) were revised. 166 object properties, which
                     existed in RiC-O 0.2 and were specific to each of the n-ary relations, could
                     then be deleted. A full accounting of the rolification of n-ary relations may
                     be found at <a href="https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/issues/67" target="_blank">https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/issues/67</a>).
                        <br/>
                  <strong>In RiC-O 1.1, 80 object properties were added, whose
                        domain or range are most often rico:RecordResource (or its subclasses),
                        rico:Proxy, rico:Instantiation, rico:Date or rico:Relation</strong>.
                     The following list describes the main additions made.<ul>
                     <li>as a rico:TitleType class was added, the object properties needed
                           to connect it to rico:Title. <strong>The names of the higher level
                              'hasOrHadCategory' and 'isOrWasCategoryOf' object properties have been
                              changed to 'hasOrHadType' and 'isOrWasTypeOf'</strong>.</li>
                     <li>a <a href="#studiesOrStudiedAt">rico:studiesOrStudiedAt</a> object property - and the inverse
                           one, <a href="#isOrWasAttendedByStudent">rico:isOrWasAttendedByStudent</a> - was added, subproperty of
                           rico:isOrWasMemberOf, to connect a Person to a Corporate Body at which
                           the person studies or studied; as already said above, the corresponding
                              <a href="#StudyingAtRelation">rico:StudyingAtRelation</a> n-ary class was also
                           created;</li>
                     <li>object properties were added to be used for accumulation dates,
                           with domain the union of rico:RecordResource and rico:Instantiation (for
                              <a href="#hasAccumulationDate">rico:hasAccumulationDate</a>), or RecordSet (for <a href="#hasOrHadAllMembersWithAccumulationDate">rico:hasOrHadAllMembersWithAccumulationDate</a>, <a href="#hasOrHadSomeMembersWithAccumulationDate">rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithAccumulationDate</a>, <a href="#hasOrHadMostMembersWithAccumulationDate">rico:hasOrHadMostMembersWithAccumulationDate</a>), along with
                           the inverse properties. Note that a parallel rico:accumulationDate
                           datatype property was also created, along with its variants for
                           rico:RecordSet. Rico:hasAccumulationDate and rico:hasCreationDate were
                           made subproperties of a new <a href="#hasOrganicProvenanceDate">rico:hasOrganicProvenanceDate</a> object property.</li>

                     manifest in a RiC-O knowledge graph. Those individuals are part of two SKOS
                     vocabularies (<a href="#documentaryFormTypes">documentaryFormTypes</a> and <a href="#recordSetTypes">recordSetTypes</a>), which have also been available from v1.0 as

            <p>Finally, significant efforts were made since the release of RiC-O 0.2
                  regarding the documentation of the ontology. In particular, <strong>the
                     labels of each class and property (rdfs:label annotations) are now available in

                  our French-speaking and Spanish-speaking colleagues, members or not of the
                  ICA/EGAD group, who contributed to this translation work. <strong>In RiC-O

         <h3>Introduction</h3>
         <p>RiC-O (Records in Contexts-Ontology) is an OWL ontology for describing archival
               record resources. As the third part of Records in Contexts standard, it is a formal
               representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM). This version, which
               is v1.1, is the latest official release. It is compliant with RiC-CM v1.0.</p>

         <div id="design-principles">
            <h4>RiC-O design principles</h4>
            <p>The following design principles were followed when developing RiC-O.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>1. RiC-O is a domain and reference ontology</strong>.</p>
            <p>RiC-O provides <strong>a generic vocabulary and formal rules for
                     creating RDF datasets (or generating them from existing archival metadata) that
                     describe in a consistent way any kind of archival record
                  resource</strong>. It supports publishing RDF datasets as Linked Data,
                  querying them using SPARQL, and making inferences using the logic of the
                  ontology.</p>
            <p>While some projects have built some specific ontologies for describing
                  archives, in 2013 no generic domain ontology existed for the specific needs of the
                  archival community. This is why EGAD decided to develop RiC-O as a part of RiC
                  standard.</p>
            <p>Apart from this first, main target, <strong>RiC-O, as a technical
                     implementation of RiC-CM that also extends and refines it and that includes
                     formal logic, can guide or inspire, in many ways, the development of any tool
                     or system that manages (i.e. stores, enables to edit or processes) and
                     publishes descriptive archival metadata.</strong>. Of course, other
                  technical implementations of RiC-CM may be developed later on. Also, the current
                  technical implementations of the former ICA standards, e.g. EAD and EAC-CPF XML
                  schemas, should be made closer to RiC-CM in the future; on this topic, see <a href="https://www2.archivists.org/groups/technical-subcommittee-on-encoded-archival-standards-ts-eas"
                  target="_blank">the news and announcements of the Technical Subcommittee on Encoded Archival
                     Standards (TS-EAS) of the Society of American Archivists</a>.</p>
            <p>As RiC-O is a generic, domain ontology, <strong>it does not address by
                     itself every specific need or expectation</strong> that may occur in every
                  archival institution or project. It is rather <strong>a high level
                     framework</strong> and an institution or project implementing RiC-O can
                  apply only such a subset of properties as meets their needs, or extend the
                  specification according to their particular requirements, or do both.</p>
            <p>As a domain ontology, RiC-O, at this stage, does not borrow from other
                  existing ontologies (such as the cultural heritage models – IFLA-LRM and
                  CIDOC-CRM, PREMIS, or PROV-O). It should therefore be easier, for an archival
                  institution or archival project, to understand, implement and maintain RiC-O
                  within its system.</p>
            <p>Alignment with those and other models, where possible, will be undertaken in
                  a future revision cycle to support the interconnected nature of resource
                  description across the domains. This is of course essential for interconnecting
                  RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O with other datasets, or for using parts of RiC-O
                  in other contexts than the archival or records management realm.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>2. RiC-O is immediately usable.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>This is a key feature</strong>. <strong>Metadata conforming
                     to superseded ICA standards can be transformed to RiC-O
                     successfully</strong>. Converting existing archival metadata created or
                  generated in current information systems and compliant with ICA standards to
                  RDF/RiC-O is possible without losing data or structure.</p>
            <p>During the ongoing development process of RiC-O, intensive conversion
                  testing, either by hand or using scripts, was conducted on XML/EAD finding aids
                  and XML/EAC-CPF authority records to ensure that RiC-O is usable with existing
                  descriptive metadata. An <a href="https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter"
                  target="_blank">open source
                     conversion software</a> was also developed, whose first version was
                  published in April 2020.</p>
            <p>While some existing metadata sets may have a very fine level of granularity
                  and accuracy, already using, for example, controlled vocabularies, or describing
                  curation events separately, often these metadata don’t have the very precise
                  structure that RiC-CM recommends. Even then, such a conversion process remains
                  possible. In order to allow this, RiC-O sometimes provides several methods for
                  representing information (as described below). From this point of view, RiC-O 1.1
                  may be considered a transitional ontology, in which some components may be
                  deprecated later on.</p>
            <p>The usability of a model also depends on its documentation. RiC-O is
                  documented extensively. The documentation will be reviewed and updated on a
                  continuing basis.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>3. RiC-O provides a flexible framework</strong>.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>This is a very important principle too</strong>. It is related
                  with the usability principle quoted above. Moreover, <strong>archival
                     description is flexible by essence</strong>. It is quite commonly noted
                  that today the level of granularity of information varies from one finding aid to
                  another (or from one authority record to another), or even within the same finding
                  aid. Some series or agents are described summarily because little is known about
                  them and there is little time for extensive research, while other series, even
                  records, or agents are described in detail; some relations (e.g. that relating to
                  provenance) may be described without any detail while others may be thoroughly
                  documented, as ISAAR(CPF) and EAC-CPF allow it.</p>
            <p>Being generally flexible, for an OWL ontology, depends first on the
                  polyhierarchical systems of classes and properties it provides. A superproperty or
                  superclass, more general or generic than its subproperties or subclasses, must
                  exist and be available for handling information, while at the same time more
                  accurate subcomponents must be there for handling more accurate description. Also,
                  RiC-O provides methods for describing relations as full entities, as well as
                  direct and short paths between entities.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>4. RiC-O opens new potential for archival description.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
               <strong>Linked Data tools and interfaces enable end users to go through
                     RDF/RiC-O graphs, query them using SPARQL, and make inferences. This means a
                     completely new way of consulting archival metadata and their multiple
                     contexts.</strong> An end user should be able to ask of any given data
                  set, for example, “What are (according to your dataset) the corporate bodies that
                  succeeded a given entity from its end of existence to now (as concerns this given
                  activity)?”, or “what instantiations of this photograph exist?”, or “what are the
                  existing copies of this original charter?”, and get a list of these entities. This
                  means that institutions or projects that invest in the implementation of RiC-O
                  will be able to query their data in ways not possible with the previous ICA
                  standards, and will get new insight into the content and context of their archives
                  that wasn’t visible with the existing ICA-standards. What is more, repositories
                  using RiC-O may infer new assertions from the RDF datasets and link them to other
                  resources outside their institution, thereby amplifying the query and inferencing
                  possibilities manifold.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>5. RiC-O is extensible.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Institutions with descriptive needs beyond what RiC-O provides out-of-the-box
                  have the option of extending the ontology by adding new subclasses or
                  subproperties as needed. Also, the concepts defined in existing SKOS vocabularies
                  (e.g. a list of documentary form types) can also be connected to RiC-O based
                  graphs (using the *Type classes, and properties which are in the domain or range
                  of these classes).</p>
            <p>RiC-O has also the potential to be usable in other contexts than purely
                  archival ones. It can be used to “hook” archival description to descriptive
                  metadata in other domains (e.g. bibliographic or museum metadata). As said above,
                  alignment with other models will be undertaken by EGAD in a future revision cycle,
                  facilitating such connections.</p>

                     <strong>Each RiC-CM entity has a corresponding class in
                           RiC-O</strong>. These classes are organized according to the same
                        hierarchy as in RiC-CM. Some projects may need very few of them (e.g. Agent,
                        Record Resource and Activity only), while others may need more (e.g.
                        Corporate Body and Person; Record; Place).</p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Many classes only exist in RiC-O and not in
                           RiC-CM</strong>. These additional classes address special
                        needs:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>
                        <strong>some correspond to RiC-CM attributes</strong>, when it
                           may be considered necessary to handle them as full entities. This is the
                           case for <a href="#Type">Type</a> and its subclasses, that
                           correspond to RiC-CM attributes that contain controlled values, and that
                           can help to articulate RiC-O with external RDF resources like SKOS

                           these classes have been grouped under a <a href="#Concept">Concept</a> class.</li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>some classes have been added in order to provide a more
                              accurate definition and model for some entities</strong>. For
                           example, <a href="#Place">Place</a> comes along with a
                              <a href="#PhysicalLocation">Physical Location
                           class</a>, and with a <a href="#Coordinates">Coordinates
                              class</a>. A Place is considered both a geographical and
                           historical entity. As a historical entity, among other features, it has a
                           history, and may be preceded or succeeded by other Places. A Place also
                           may have zero to many Physical Location through time (for instance, its
                           boundaries, if it is an administrative area or a country, may change).
                           Each Physical Location may be connected to zero to many Coordinates. This
                           model is quite close to the Linked Places Format (<a href="https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places" target="_blank">https://github.com/LinkedPasts/linked-places</a>).</li>

                           a Record Resource as it exists in a specific other Record Resource, and
                           may therefore be useful when you describe records which are
                           simultaneously included in several distinct record resources.</li>
                     <li>
                        <strong>finally, a system of n-ary classes helps to implement the
                              Relations section of RiC-CM</strong>. While these relations also
                           are represented as simple, binary object properties (e.g. <a href="#hasOrganicProvenance">hasOrganicProvenance</a> that
                           corresponds to RiC-R026 relation), you may need to assign different
                           attributes to a relation, e.g. a date, certainty or description, as it is
                           already possible, and quite often done, in a XML/EAC-CPF file. One of the
                           standard available methods for representing such a documented relation in
                           RDF for now is to use a class. Thus, for example, in RiC-O a <a href="#OrganicProvenanceRelation">OrganicProvenanceRelation
                              class</a> exists. Instances of this class can connect one to many
                           Agents to one to many created or accumulated Record Resources or
                           Instantiations, which actually is a quite common situation. In addition
                           to properties that can be used for any Thing, they may have some specific
                           object properties, like <a href="#relationHasDate">rico:relationHasDate</a> that was added in RiC-O 1.1, or <a href="#relationCertainty">rico:relationCertainty</a>,
                              <a href="#relationSource">rico:relationSource</a>,
                              <a href="#relationState">rico:relationState</a>). Back
                           to the <a href="#hasOrganicProvenance">hasOrganicProvenance</a> object property, let us add that it is
                           formally defined in RiC-O, using OWL 2 property chain axiom (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F8:_Property_Chain_Inclusion"
                           target="_blank">https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-new-features/#F8:_Property_Chain_Inclusion</a>),

                           ‘thingIsSourceOfRelation/organicProvenanceRelation_role/relationHasTarget’,
                           where the intermediate node is an instance of OrganicProvenanceRelation:<br/>

                  <h6>2. About RiC-O datatype properties (relations whose object is a
                        literal)</h6>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Most of the datatype properties in RiC-O correspond to RiC-CM
                           attributes that contain free, plain text</strong>. See for example
                           <a href="#generalDescription">rico:generalDescription</a>,
                           <a href="#history">rico:history</a> and <a href="#scopeAndContent">rico:scopeAndContent</a>.</p>
                  <p>In many simple use cases it’s sufficent to just use the <a href="#identifier">rico:identifier</a> or <a href="#name">rico:name</a> datatype properties. However, as
                        already said, in addition to these datatype properties, the Name and
                        Identifier RiC-CM attributes also have corresponding classes (subclasses of
                           <a href="#Appellation">rico:Appellation</a>). A resource
                        may have several Identifiers (e.g. archival reference code, system number,
                        digital object identifier) or Names and each comes with different
                        attributes; in this case instances of classes are needed. The Location
                        RiC-CM attribute also has a <a href="#PhysicalLocation">rico:PhysicalLocation</a> corresponding class (for users who want
                        to use Place, Physical Location and Coordinates for handling
                        places).</p>
                  <p>As already said too, every RiC-CM attribute that has ‘controlled value’
                        or ‘rule-based’ as a schema value, has a class as corresponding component in
                        RiC-O. <strong>However, for these CM attributes that correspond to a
                           RiC-O class, as it is necessary to provide an immediately usable
                           ontology, two supplementary datatype properties exist that allow not to
                           use the classes, at least for a while, if you want to implement RiC-O and
                           create RiC-O/RDF datasets from existing archival metadata without being
                           able to handle URIs for the information you have</strong>.</p>
                  <p>For example, you may not be able to handle and maintain URIs for some
                        controlled values you use in EAD finding aids for carrier types: maybe your
                        information system does not use a vocabulary for this, and you cannot for a
                        while consider these carrier types as full entities. Nevertheless you want
                        to produce RiC-O datasets where every piece of information is kept, and you
                        want to avoid blank nodes. If RiC-O would only provide the Carrier Type
                        class, it would be an issue for you.</p>
                  <p>So RiC-O provides a <a href="#type">rico:type</a>
                        datatype property, with range rdfs:literal, which allows you to move
                        forward. For RiC-CM Coordinates attribute, you also have the <a href="#geographicalCoordinates">rico:geographicalCoordinates</a> datatype property.</p>
                  <p>These datatype properties have a skos:scopeNote which says (for
                        example) "Provided for usability reasons. May be made deprecated or removed
                        later on. Use only if you don’t use Physical Location and Coordinates
                        classes with Place."</p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>The same key design principle (RiC-O must be immediately
                           usable) led us to define some datatype properties that would enable users
                           to use RiC-O in simple use cases where they do not want to consider dates
                           and rules as full entities</strong>. Thus, there of course is Date
                        and Rule classes in RiC-O (since there are Date and Rule entities in
                        RiC-CM). And <strong>you also have a <a href="#date">rico:date</a> datatype property, which has several
                           subproperties; plus a <a href="#ruleFollowed">rico:ruleFollowed</a> datatype property</strong>. The same
                        analysis led us to keep the <a href="#history">rico:history</a> datatype property in RiC-O (same as RiC-CM history
                        attribute), while RiC-CM and RiC-O also provide the <a href="#Event">Event</a> class, and using a series of Events may
                        of course be a better method, easier to query, link and display, than simply
                        using a history prose discourse. The two methods may be used in parallel
                        within the same dataset by an institution that, for example, would decide to
                        emphasize only the accession, appraisal and description events among the
                        whole history of Record Resources.</p>
                  <p>These datatype properties have the same kind of skos:scopeNote as
                        above.</p>
                  <p>Finally, <strong>we have introduced a few datatype properties that
                           do not correspond to any RiC-CM attribute</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Some are superproperties, and thus group datatype properties: <a href="#physicalOrLogicalExtent">rico:physicalOrLogicalExtent</a>, with rico:carrierExtent,
                        rico:instantiationExtent and rico:recordResourceExtent as subproperties;
                           <a href="#textualValue">rico:textualValue</a>, with
                        rico:expressedDate, rico:normalizedValue and rico:quantity as subproperties;
                           <a href="#measure">rico:measure</a>; <a href="#referenceSystem">rico:referenceSystem</a>; <a href="#note">rico:note</a> (added in RiC-O 1.1), with
                        rico:authenticityNote, rico:integrityNote and
                        rico:physicalCharacteristicsNote as subproperties.</p>
                  <p>Some are simply more specific properties, like: <a href="#accrualsStatus">rico:accrualsStatus</a>; <a href="#recordResourceStructure">rico:recordResourceStructure</a> and <a href="#instantiationStructure">rico:instantiationStructure</a>,
                        subproperties of rico:structure; <a href="#title">rico:title</a> (subproperty of rico:name); <a href="#altitude"> &gt;rico:altitude</a>, <a href="#height">rico:height</a>, <a href="#latitude">rico:latitude</a>, <a href="#length">rico:length</a>, <a href="#longitude">rico:longitude</a>, <a href="#width">rico:width</a>
                        (subproperties of rico:measure), <a href="#geodesicSystem">rico:geodesicSystem</a> and <a href="#altimetricSystem">rico:altimetricSystem</a> (subproperties of rico:referenceSystem);
                           <a href="#sentimentOrEmotionExpressed">rico:sentimentOrEmotionExpressed</a> (added in RiC-O 1.1),
                        subproperty of rico:scopeAndContent.</p>

                  <p>In order to connect all the classes created, <strong>a significant
                           number of object properties have been defined, in addition to the 85
                           relations defined in RiC-CM 1.0.</strong>
                  </p>
                  <p>While the 'flat' list of object properties is a long one,
                           <strong>the object properties are grouped
                           hierarchically</strong>, so that one can use the upper to
                        intermediate level ones for simplicity sake, or choose the most accurate and
                        expressive ones, or extend the system adding a subproperty easily. It is
                        expected that, in most use cases, a subset of these properties only will be
                        needed.</p>
                  <p>Below we just give a few details on certain specific sets of
                        properties.</p>
                  <p>While in RiC-CM it was not possible to achieve such a level of
                        precision with simple attributes, <strong>RiC-O includes object
                           properties to assert that a <a href="#RecordSet">rico:RecordSet</a> has or had members (either all of them, or
                           some of them) that share some characteristics</strong>, like
                        Language, ContentType, DocumentaryFormType, LegalStatus, RecordState, and
                        (added recently) accumulation or creation Date, or a subject (as a
                        rico:Thing). See for example <a href="#hasOrHadAllMembersWithType">rico:hasOrHadAllMembersWithType</a>, or <a href="#hasOrHadSomeMembersWithSubject">rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithSubject</a> and its
                        subproperties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Some of the object properties are formally defined as
                           shortcuts</strong>: they can be inferred if you create triples that
                        include instances of the Relation classes. See the example explained above
                        in the <a href="#RiC-O_classes">section dedicated to classes</a>.
                        In RiC-O 1.1, some object properties that connect a RecordResource or an
                        Agent to a Date are also now defined as shortcuts, like <a href="#isOrWasActiveAtDate">rico:isOrWasActiveAtDate</a> or

                           manifests, which can be considered as Records. For example, a Record with
                           Documentary Form Type ‘Finding Aid’ may be connected to one to many
                           Record Resources using the ‘rico:describes’ object property.</li>

            <h4>Next steps</h4>
            <p>The following is a non exhaustive list of known issues, topics or tasks on
                  which EGAD has begun to work and will continue to work in the next months. These
                  topics are part of the roadmap for RiC-O 2.0.</p>
            <ul>
               <li>articulate the Event and Activity classes, and the Relation system of
                     classes</li>
               <li>add suggestions of mappings (in rico:closeTo) and OWL equivalences
                     between some classes or properties and components in other models (among which
                     - this is not an exhaustive list- PREMIS, Schema.org, PROV-O, IFLA-LRM and RDA,
                     CIDOC-CRM), or document how these models can be used together. </li>
               <li>develop multilingual vocabularies in order to provide users with means to
                     populate RiC-CM attributes that have a controlled value, and to use shared
                     instances of RiC-O *Type classes, so that their RDF datasets would be easier to
                     query using SPARQL federated queries or portals, and to link to each other.
                     Such a task will probably start with curation Activity Types and Rule Types, in
                     addition to more Record Set Types and Documentary Form Types than the seven
                     ones already defined.</li>

               <dd>The doing of something for some human purpose.</dd>
               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>Activity is a kind of Event. Activity is specifically used to
         designate purposeful human activity. Activity may be understood from two perspectives.
         First it can be understood as leading to an end. The end is the purpose of the Activity, or
         why the Activity is performed. Second, it can be understood in terms of the processes that
         lead to achieving the end, how the end is realized through coordinated actions. Purpose and
         process are complementary understandings of Activity. Together the two perspectives address
         why the Activity is performed, the expected ends or outcomes; and how the Activity fulfills
         the purpose. While activity has an intended end, it also has unintended consequences and
         results, or side-effects. By and large, these may not be the focus of the description, but
         they are, unquestionably, context. |In a corporate or government context an Activity may
         also be called a 'function'. An Activity exists in a specific social and cultural context,
         and within that context is subject to change over time. An Activity may be composed of
         other Activities.</dd>

               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>An Agent may have one or more identities; an identity is a
         constellation of properties or relations that together “identify” the Agent. A Person or
         Group commonly has one identity, though each also may have one or more alternative
         identities. Such alternative identities may be shared by more than one Person or Group.
         Alternative identities include but are not limited to pseudonyms, heteronyms, DBA (Doing
         Business As), and trade identities. An alternative identity should not be confused with a
         Position in a Group, for example, presidents, prime ministers, governors, popes, royalty,
         or bishops. Nor should an alternative identity be confused with a variant name or
         identifier of the same identity. Agent also includes entities created by a Person or Group
         that act on behalf of the creating Agent in an autonomous or semi-autonomous manner.
         Examples of a Mechanism include software agents, robots, and space and underwater probes
         that generate data (records) in the course of Activity assigned to and in conformance with
         the instructions given to them by the creating Person or Group.</dd>

               <dd>Corporate body is a kind of Group (RiC-E09). By exception,
         within some legal contexts, a sole trader or sole proprietor may be recognized as a
         corporate body, even when the economic enterprise does not have additional members.
         Corporate bodies often have a mandate giving them the authority to act within their area(s)
         of competence. They will also usually act within a particular jurisdiction being governed
         by legal and other rule-based frameworks. A corporate body though may be constituted in a
         more informal manner and exist as an entity by virtue of its recognition as such by its
         members.</dd>

               <dd>Family is a kind of Group. “Family” is used here as a general
         term that encompasses a wide variety of familial groups. Other types of familial groups
         include Dynasty, Clan, House, Tribe and others. Though family may be a recognized legal
         group in specific contexts, the term may also be used for groups that are socially
         recognized as families. A family may be a group of persons related either by consanguinity
         or affinity or cohabitation or other social conventions. In some context, a Family may be
         legally recognized as Corporate Body. For example, certain North American peoples (tribes)
         retain self-government rights and have jurisdiction over defined tribal
         lands.</dd>

               <dd>The inscription of information made by an Agent on a physical
         carrier in any persistent, recoverable form as a means of communicating information through
         time and space.</dd>
               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>A Record or Record Part must have been instantiated at least
         once, though this instantiation may no longer exist at the moment of description. An
         instantiation might also exist at the moment of description, but be destroyed at a later
         moment in time, when, for example, a derived instantiation might become the only remaining
         instantiation. A Record Set may have an instantiation, which is to say that it is not a
         necessary condition. An Instantiation may be derived from another Instantiation. A Record
         Resource may have many Instantiations simultaneously (for instance, a record printed and
         saved in the same time as DOCX and PDF/A would have 3 concurrent instantiations) or through
         time (for example, copy of a record). Depending on the context, a new instantiation may be
         seen as a new or as the same record resource. During in the process of re-instantiation
         something is lost and something is preserved, but it is up to the context and the Agent
         that produces or uses that Instantiation to assess whether the two instantiations are
         functionally equivalent or not. For instance, a postcard representing a town map from 1874
         (Instantiation 1) is digitized and kept as a JPEG file (Instantiation 2). The digital copy
         may be considered as instantiating the "same" Record by an Agent considering the
         information transmitted by the Record (e.g., the urban landscape displayed), but as a"
         different" Record by an antiquarian more focused on the materiality of the carrier.
         Successive instantiations may change the perceivable boundaries of a Record Resource. For
         instance, a case file comprising many records may be digitized and saved as one single PDF
         file, which, from management perspective, may be treated as one Record. Similarly, a large
         Record Set (a fonds or a series) may be maintained as one database. On the other hand, one
         record (main document and its annexes) may be digitized in separate files and each one may
         be managed as a discrete “physical” item. Instantiations may require mediation to
         communicate the information in the Record Resource. While a traditional Record on paper can
         simply be read by an Agent in order to understand the information, a vinyl recording, a
         video cassette or a digital file needs a device (mediator) to codify or decodify the
         information conveyed. This mediator may imply simple physical components (a turntable
         needle, for example), or a complex gallery of software and hardware elements.
         Instantiations are more than the mere informational content of Record Resource and may be
         the focus of preservation and physical management of records. The use of particular
         document types for records, such as a medieval charter, may have implications for the
         authenticity of the records. Hence, the way a Record Resource is instantiated contributes
         to the contextualizing of the content.record resource is instantiated contributes to the
         contextualizing the content. Distinguishing the message conveyed (Record Resource) and its
         physical representations (Instantiation) allows for the efficient management of their
         descriptions, and preserve information about a Record Resource even when no physical
         representation of it exists or is known to exist anymore. The relations between distinct
         instantiations can then be expressed wherever they coexist, and they can be related to the
         Record Resource they instantiate.</dd>

               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>Mandate is a kind of Rule. A mandate confers the responsibility
         or authority of an agent to perform a specified activity. In addition to assigning an
         activity and delegating responsibility or authority to perform the activity to an agent, a
         mandate commonly limits the place (jurisdiction) and date (time period) within which an
         agent may perform the activity (where and when). Mandates exist in a specific social and
         cultural context, and within that context are subject to change over time. While a mandate
         may be tacit, in whole or part, it may be explicitly expressed in a variety of documentary
         sources (for example, constitutions, legislation, (legal) acts, statutes, legal codes,
         ordinances, charges, charters, or mission statements). The evidence for identifying a
         mandate may be found in its entirety in one documentary source (for example, a law or
         regulation), or may be found in two or more sources. A mandate should not be confused with
         the one or more documentary sources that serve as evidence of its identity. A documentary
         source is a record.</dd>

         experience, or a combination of both. The authority of the Person to pursue the occupation
         may be derived tacitly or explicitly from an external Agent, based on a demonstrated
         mastery of the competency. An occupation may be pursued independently by a Person or a
         Group, thereby contributing to the fulfilment of the function (activity) of the group.
         Should not be confused with Position where, for example, an agent with the occupation type
         "lawyer" holds the position of "legal counsel" in an agency. Related to but should not be
         confused with the domain or field of activity, such as an archivist who works in the domain
         of archival science.</dd>

               <dd>An individual human being.</dd>
               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>Person is a kind of Agent. Most commonly, a human being
         (biological person) has a single socially constructed identity or persona. Less common
         though not rare, one or more personae in addition to the original persona which emerges at
         or near birth may be associated with the human being over the course of that human being’s
         lifetime. Such "alternative personae" are most often created by the original person for
         specific purposes. The original persona may, in everyday discourse, be regarded as “the
         real person”. Under some circumstances, an alternative persona might eclipse or replace the
         original person (Mark Twain eclipsing Samuel Clemens; John Wayne eclipsing Marion Mitchell
         Morrison), that is, the alternative identity becomes the predominant identity. Less common
         is when two or more persons collaborate to create a shared persona. A persona shared by two
         or more persons constitutes a kind of group. Within the archival context, the description
         of a person commonly will focus on the original associated persona, with alternative
         personae noted. Exceptionally, an alternative persona may displace the original persona as
         the focus of the description. Under some circumstances, for example, when record resources
         are associated with two or more different personae of one person, describing the different
         personae as separate though related persons may be desirable. Alternatively, a person may
         change their identity over the course of their lifetime.</dd>

               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>Position is a kind of Agent. Position is the intersection of a
         Person and a Group. Position exists independently of the Person that holds the Position
         within a Group. More than one Person may hold a Position. Position is commonly defined in a
         Mandate, often called a position description or job description. The Mandate may specify
         the work to be performed (Activity) as well as the competencies for performing the
         Activity. A Position is often given a Name. A Position may be tied to a project or to a set
         of tasks and thus have a defined duration. A Position may change over time, as the Group
         that establishes it changes over time. Position is not to be confused with Occupation or
         Activity. Within the records created by a Corporate Body, a Position may be used to
         identify the record sets resulting from activities performed by one or more persons holding
         the Position over time, without necessarily identifying or describing the Person or
         persons, or identifying which records were created by each Person.</dd>

               <dt>Definition</dt>
               <dd>Information produced or acquired and retained by an Agent in the
         course of life or work activity.</dd>
               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>Record resource is a kind of Thing. Producing a record resource
         may imply either its initial creation or a reuse of previous existing information by
         combination, rearrangement, selecting, reformatting, etc. Record set, record, and record
         part are kinds of record resource. A record resource is evidence of the activity of an
         agent. More than one agent may be involved in the creation of a record resource. The role
         of the agent in creating the record resource may take different forms, for example,
         authoring of an individual record, accumulating a record set, or arranging a record set.
         Though a record, record set, and record part, under most circumstances, may be easily
         distinguished from one another, identifying the boundary of each may frequently present
         particular challenges. Documentary forms provide the rules governing the structure of many
         types of records, providing criteria for identifying a record's boundary, and identifying
         its essential parts. Many records, though, do not have well-established documentary forms,
         particularly in the case of digital records, where it may be difficult to determine whether
         individual elements represented in separate bitstreams are record parts, records, or record
         sets. For example, is photographic information represented independently in a bitstream
         embedded in a text document a record or a record part? Or is the same photographic
         information attached to an email that maintains its independent representation, a record or
         a record part? Information grouped for some purpose, for example, ZIP or TAR "file
         compression" for saving storage space, presents a further challenge. One file comprises
         multiple bitstreams subjected to techniques that remove bits that can be losslessly
         recovered when decompressed. Under what circumstances is such a compressed bitstream a
         record or a record set? Determining when an information object is a record, record set, or
         record part is based on perspective and judgement exercised in a particular context. In one
         context, the agent describing an information object may designate it a record, while
         another agent in a different context may designate it a record part. Both designations are
         supported by RiC-CM, and the significance of the difference for users of the records is
         ameliorated by the fact that all of the attributes and relations employed in describing
         record and record part are shared, as are many of the attributes and relations employed in
         describing a record set.</dd>

         end-user, etc.) may select the member records of a Record Set based on any shared attribute
         or attributes, or any shared relation or relations. The grouping of the records serves a
         purpose or purposes specific to the context of the Agent. For example, all member records
         of a Record Set have been accumulated by the same Agent; have the same Documentary Form
         Type; or are related to and document the same Activity. A Record Set may represent the act
         of classifying the records in accordance with a formal classification scheme that may be
         based on activity, subject, organizational structure, or other criteria; an act of archival
         arrangement (for example, based on common provenance); or some other selection and grouping
         that fulfils a particular purpose or purposes (for example, a classification that reflects
         or supports the purposes of a researcher). By exception, some records are brought together
         based on their not belonging in the context of selection to other designated groups: a
         'Miscellaneous' series, for example. A Record Sset accumulated by an Agent in the course of
         life or work activity should be described in a manner that preserves context and evidential
         value. Record Sets may also contain other Record Sets. A Record Set or Record may
         simultaneously be a member of more than one Record Set, and over the course of its
         existence, a Record Set or Record may be a member of an indeterminate number of Record Sets
         in an indeterminate number of contexts. Record Sets and Records contained within a Record
         Set may be ordered into a sequence based on a common property or relation, or common
         properties or relations (for example, alphabetical by agent or related place);
         chronological order by creation date; or some other criterion (for example, an imposed
         order by relevance).</dd>

               <dt>Definition</dt>
               <dd>The top level relation class. It connects at least two Things. An
         instance of a Relation may have some datatype and object properties: a general description
         (datatype property) like any Thing; a certainty (for 'certain', 'quite probable',
         'uncertain','unknown'); a date (use either the date datatype property or the Date class and
         isAssociatedWithDate object property); a state (relationState); a location (use the Place
         class and isAssociatedWithPlace object property); a source of information that can be used
         as an evidence for it (use either source datatype property or hasSource object property).
         This Relation is the most generic one; it is not oriented.</dd>
               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>Use when direct, binary object properties are not enough, e.g.
         when you need to record a date, a location or any other descriptive element for a relation
         (till RDF-Star becomes a W3C recommendation and provides a lighter method for doing so); or
         when the relation invloves more than two entities (n-ary relation). It is recommended to
         use the subclasses of the Relation class.</dd>

               <dd>Rule is a kind of Thing. Rule can be related directly to agent,
         activity, or anything created or managed by agents, such as a record resource or
         instantiation. A rule may be unwritten or written or otherwise documented. Unwritten rules
         may include though are not limited to the following: social mores, customs, or community
         expectations. Written rules may include though are not limited to the following:
         constitutions, legislation, acts (legal), statutes, legal codes, ordinances, charters,
         mission statements, regulations, policies, procedures, instructions, codes of conduct or
         ethics, professional standards, work assignments, or work plans. The source or sources of
         some rules governing the existence or activity of an agent may be external (for example,
         expressed in elections, social mores, customs, community expectations, laws, regulations,
         standards, and best practice codes), while others may be expressed within the immediate
         context of an agent (for example, policies, or written or verbal instructions). The
         evidence for identifying rules may be found in their entirety in one documentary source
         (for example, a law or regulation) or may be found in two or more sources. Rule should not
         be confused with the one or more documentary sources that serve as evidence of its
         identity. A documentary source is a record.</dd>

               <dt>Definition</dt>
               <dd>Number of physical units and/or physical dimensions of the carrier
         of an Instantiation. In order to manage an Instantiation of a record resource it is
         necessary to note the extent of the carrier as well as that of the Instantiation itself.
         Whether it is necessary to note dimensions, the number of relevant units, or both, depends
         on the nature of the carrier and particular business needs.</dd>
               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>For digital resources, it may be used to indicate the size of
         storage capacity (disk, tape, film, etc.). Carrier extent should not be confused with
         instantiation extent or record resource extent. For a given Record Resource, the
         instantiation extent may vary, based on format, density of information on the carrier, etc.
         For example, a CD with a storage capacity of 700 MB (carrier extent) might hold a record of
         1500 words (record resource extent) represented in two versions, one a Word document with
         an instantiation extent of 3 KB and the other a PDF file with an instantiation extent of 5
         KB. </dd>

         entity, it may be desirable, for economic or other reasons, to describe two or more
         specific properties together. Second, general description may be used to describe one or
         more characteristics that are not otherwise accommodated in RiC-O. Third, it may be used to
         provide a succinct summary or abstract description in addition to more detailed specific
         description.</dd>

               <dd>A word, number, letter, symbol, or any combination of these used
         to uniquely identify or reference an individual instance of an entity within a specific
         information domain. Can include Global Persistent Identifiers (globally unique and
         persistently resolvable identifier for the entity) and/or Local Identifiers. Both the
         domain within which the identifier is unique, and the rules used in forming the identifier
         value should be provided with the identifier value.</dd>
               <dt>Scope note</dt>
               <dd>Use only if you don't use Identifier class for handling
         identifiers. Within a given domain (a closed system), identifiers are used to uniquely
         reference instances of an entity. Identifiers are instruments of control that facilitate
         management of the entities within the domain. The formulation of identifiers commonly is
         based on rules. In addition to an identifier needing to be unique within a domain, it is
         also highly desirable that it be persistent, that is, that the identifier uniquely
         identifies the entity over time. A variety of organizations provide rules for the formation
         of identifiers, and services designed to facilitate the persistence of identifiers. Such
         identifiers are commonly referred to as Persistent Identifiers (or PIDs). PIDs conform to
         RFC 3986, but impose additional rules. Common examples are Archival Resource Keys (ARKs)
         and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs). Within the global environment of the Internet, there
         are special rules for the formation of identifiers to ensure that they are unique within
         the domain of the Internet. Such identifiers must conform to the Internet Engineering Task
         Force (IETF) Uniform Resource Identifier rules (RFC 3986).</dd>

               was available in RiC-0 0.1 and RiC-O 0.2, and was removed in RiC-O 1.0.</dd>

         rico:hasDocumentaryFormType object property, or its inverse one. They also can be used to
         specify that a rico:RecordSet included or includes members whose some
         (rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType) or all
         (rico:hasOrHadAllMembersWithDocumentaryFormType) have some Documentary Form Type. Each
         concept is both defined as a skos:Concept and a rico:DocumentaryFormType, so that it is
         possible to extend the classic definition of such concepts using RiC-O properties. For
         example, you can use rico:history, rico:date, or rico:isAssociatedWithPlace,
         rico:precedesInTime, if you consider a documentary form type as being a historical entity,
         known and used in some known space or time region.</dd>

            <li>2023, August 28: changed the domain of hasExtent (from Instantiation or
                     RecordResource to Thing), same for the range of isExtentOf; added a length

                     property and the 'hasSource'/'isSourceOf' object properties, which had been
                     created in RC-O 0.1 and removed in RiC-O 1.0.</li>
            <li>2025, January 17: <strong>added a 'note' datatype
                        property</strong>, superproperty of the existing 'integrityNote',
                     'authenticityNote' and 'physicalCharacteristicsNote' properties.</li>
            <li>2025, January 30: <strong>added a 'IIIFManifest' SKOS Concept, RiC-O
                        Documentary Form Type, to the named individuals</strong>. Made it a
                     concept of the vocabulary on documentary form types and a narrower concept of
                     FindingAid.</li>
            <li>2025, February 19: <strong>changed definitions so that dates for
                        destruction, accumulation, creation and publication could be in the future.
                        Added hasMigrationDate, isMigrationDateOf and migrationDate. Restricted the
                        domain of hasDestructionDate and of destructionDate</strong>
            </li>
            <li>2025, March 1st: fixed a bug (made isPublicationDateOf a subproperty of
                     isDateAssociatedWith, instead of isBeginningDateOf). <strong>Added
                        'hasDerivationDate', 'isDerivationDateOf' and
                     'derivationDate'</strong>. Changed the rdfs:subpropertyOf of
                     hasMigrationDate, isMigrationDateOf and of migrationDate accordingly. Removed
                     the mention of Record Resource from the rdfs:comment of isMigrationDateOf and
                     migrationDate.</li>
            <li>2025, March 4th: <strong>introduced datatype properties
                        rankInSequence and rankInHierarchy, expanded the range of proxyIn to any
                        RecordResource and tweaked the definition of it and proxyFor accordingly,
                        added an inverse property hasProxy for proxyFor, added two new
                        sub-properties proxyInRecord and proxyInRecordSet of ProxyIn, introduced 36
                        object properties pertaining to use of Proxy in sequences or hierarchies,
                        and added one or two property chain axioms involving rico:Proxy to a few
                        object properties used to define sequences or
                     hierarchies</strong>.</li>
            <li>2025, March 6th: added a new object property 'isOrWasActiveAtDate' and an
                     inverse.</li>
            <li>2025, March 13: added French and Spanish labels to the object properties
                     that connect Date and Relation, and to the
                     isOrganicProvenanceDateOf/hasOrganicProvenanceDate properties. Fixed the domain
                     and a rdfs:subPropertyOf of isDateAssociatedWithRelation. Also added property
                     chain axioms to hasDerivationDate, hasMigrationDate and to their inverse
                     properties.</li>
            <li>2025, April 2nd: reviewed the new properties for Proxies, hierarchies and
                     sequences. Fixed a few owl:inverseOf, owl:subPropertyOf and a property chain
                     axiom. Modified a few details in the rdfs:comment of those properties. Added
                     French and Spanish labels to these new properties.</li>
            <li>2025, April 3rd: renamed the inverse property of 'isOrWasActiveAtDate',
                     adjusted the rdfs:comment of the two properties, added a chain property axiom
                     and French and Spanish labels.</li>
            <li>2025, April 5th: <strong>added hasContentWhichRepresents and
                        hasContentWhichMainlyRepresents properties</strong>, with domain Record
                     or Record Part, and the inverse properties.</li>
            <li>2025, April 6th: Added the sentimentOrEmotionExpressed datatype property,
                     with domain Record or Record Part. <strong>Added the object properties
                        needed to connect a Record Set, some or all of whose members have subject or
                        main subject a Thing, or represent a Thing, and this Thing, plus the inverse
                        properties</strong>. Adjusted the Spanish labels of several existing
                     object properties.</li>
            <li>2025, April 8th: <strong>Added German labels to the 107 RiC-O
                        classes</strong>.</li>
            <li>2025, May 12th: revised and updated the ontology metadata.</li>
            <li>2025, May 14th: added a dcat:version to the two skos:ConceptScheme named
                     individuals.</li>
