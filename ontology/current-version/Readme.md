# Current version of RiC-O ontology, and accompanying material

This folder contains **the OWL 2 source file of RiC-O 1.0** ([RiC-O_1.0.rdf file](RiC-O_1-0.rdf)).

In addition to this file, the [HTML_view](./HTML_view) subfolder contains an HTML page allowing anyone with an internet browser to easily consult the contents of the OWL file and read the specification. Once you have downloaded the folder, simply open the [RiC-O_1-0_documentation.html file](./HTML_view/RiC-O_1-0_documentation.html) in your browser.

The [modularized-version](./modularized-version) subfolder contains a set of files which, when used together, are equivalent to the [RiC-O_1.0.rdf file](RiC-O_1-0.rdf). You will find more information about this modularized version of RiC-O in the Readme file that comes with it.
Note that **for now, the reference version of RiC-O remains the RiC-O_1.0.rdf file. It is therefore strongly recommended to use the RiC-O_1-0.rdf file in preference to the modularized version**.
