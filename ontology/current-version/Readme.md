# Current version of RiC-O ontology, and accompanying material

This folder contains **the OWL 2 source file of RiC-O 1.0.1** ([RiC-O_1-0-1.rdf file](RiC-O_1-0-1.rdf)).

In addition to this file, the [HTML_view](./HTML_view) subfolder contains an HTML page allowing anyone with an internet browser to easily consult the contents of the OWL file. Once you have downloaded the folder, simply open the [RiC-O_1-0-1_documentation.html file](./HTML_view/RiC-O_1-0-1_documentation.html) in your browser.


The [modularized-version](./modularized-version) subfolder contains a set of files which, when used together, are equivalent to the [RiC-O_1-0-1.rdf file](RiC-O_1-0-1.rdf). You will find more information about this modularized version of RiC-O in the Readme file that comes with it.
Note that **for now, the reference version of RiC-O remains the RiC-O_1-0-1.rdf file. It is therefore strongly recommended to use the RiC-O_1-0-1.rdf file in preference to the modularized version**.

The [CSV_lists_of_components](./CSV_lists_of_components) subfolder contains three CSV files (encoded in UTF-8, comma separated values, column values ​​enclosed in quotation marks ('"')). Each of these files respectively contains, in tabular format, the specifications of the classes, datatype properties and object properties defined by RiC-O 1.0.1. They include the change notes added to these components since RiC-O 0.2. They were generated automatically from the RiC-O_1-0-1.rdf file, and can be useful for simply discovering the content of the ontology, if you do not have an ontology editor or if you are not comfortable with RDF, RDFS and OWL languages. They can also be used to understand what specific changes have been made in RiC-O since version 0.2.
