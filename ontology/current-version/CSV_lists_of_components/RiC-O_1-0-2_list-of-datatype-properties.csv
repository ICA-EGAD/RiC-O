Within a given domain (a closed system), identifiers are used to uniquely reference instances of an entity. Identifiers are instruments of control that facilitate management of the entities within the domain. The formulation of identifiers commonly is based on rules. In addition to an identifier needing to be unique within a domain, it is also highly desirable that it be persistent, that is, that the identifier uniquely identifies the entity over time. A variety of organizations provide rules for the formation of identifiers, and services designed to facilitate the persistence of identifiers. Such identifiers are commonly referred to as Persistent Identifiers (or PIDs). PIDs conform to RFC 3986, but impose additional rules. Common examples are Archival Resource Keys (ARKs) and Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs).
