# Records in Contexts Ontology (RiC-O)


This is the public GitHub repository that holds the source files on RiC-O OWL ontology.

**ICA RiC-O (Records in Contexts-Ontology) is an OWL 2 ontology for describing archival record resources**. As the third part of Records in Contexts (RiC) standard, it is a formal representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM).

The **latest public release of RiC-O, RiC-O 1.0.1, dated May 2024, is now available.** It was released a few weeks after the first stable and complete version of this ontology, thus a major milestone, **RiC-O 1.0**. Apart from slightly modifying or updating a few details in the introduction and fixing a few typos in the documentation of RiC-O 1.0, version 1.0.1 only brings one change: it fixes the IRI of 'hasOrHadSomeMemberswithDocumentaryFormType' object property (changed to 'rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType'). It is **fully compliant with RiC-CM 1.0**, which is available in the corresponding repository [https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM).
               
The OWL/RDF file of RiC-O 1.0.1 is stored in the [ontology/current-version](./ontology/current-version) folder of this repository, with accompanying material, including a HTML version provided for human readers.
The repository also contains other resources, among which examples and diagrams.

**RiC-O 1.0.1 is also accessible to humans and machines through its IRI, [https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology](https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology)**.

**You can easily download the whole content of this repository using the latest release.
