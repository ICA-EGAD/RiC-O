# Records in Contexts Ontology (RiC-O)


This is the public GitHub repository that holds the source files on RiC-O OWL ontology.

**ICA RiC-O (Records in Contexts-Ontology) is an OWL 2 ontology for describing archival record resources**. As the third part of Records in Contexts (RiC) standard, it is a formal representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM).

The **latest public release of RiC-O, RiC-O 1.0, dated December 30, 2023, is now available.** As the first stable and complete version of this ontology, **RiC-O 1.0 is thus a major milestone**. It is **fully compliant with RiC-CM 1-0**, which is available in the corresponding repository [https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM).
               
The OWL/RDF file of RiC-O 1.0 is stored in the [ontology/current-version](./ontology/current-version) folder of this repository, with accompanying material, including a HTML version provided for human readers.
The repository also contains other resources, among which examples and diagrams.
