# Records in Contexts Ontology (RiC-O)


This is the public GitHub repository that holds the source files on RiC-O OWL ontology.

ICA RiC-O (Records in Contexts-Ontology) is an OWL 2 ontology for describing archival record resources. As the second part of Records in Contexts (RiC) standard, it is a formal representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM).



The **latest public release, RiC-O v1.0-beta, dated November 14, 2023, is available for download here.** The OWL/RDF file is stored in the ontology/current-version folder. **It is compliant with RiC-CM 1-0, whose version beta is available in the corresponding repository [https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM). Though it is a beta version, that should be used for tests only, it is very close to RiC-O 1.0, which will be released by the end of November.**
