# Records in Contexts Ontology (RiC-O)


This is the public GitHub repository that holds the source files on RiC-O OWL ontology.

**ICA RiC-O (Records in Contexts-Ontology) is an OWL 2 ontology for describing archival record resources and their layers of contexts**. As the third part of Records in Contexts (RiC) standard, it is a formal representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM).

The **latest public release of RiC-O, RiC-O 1.1, dated May 2025, is now available.** Version 1.1 follows the release of RiC-O 1.0.2, dated September 2024, the release of RiC-O 1.0.1, dated May 2024, and the release of the first stable and complete version of this ontology, thus a major milestone, **RiC-O 1.0**. 

Version 1.0.1 modified a few details in the introduction, fixed a few typos in the documentation of RiC-O 1.0, and brought one change only, fixing the IRI of 'hasOrHadSomeMemberswithDocumentaryFormType' object property (changed to [rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType](https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology#rico:hasOrHadSomeMembersWithDocumentaryFormType)). Version 1.0.2 fixed an inconsistency bug in RiC-O 1.0, removing global reflexivity from the 48 rolification object properties. It also fixed the French labels of six object properties. Finally, a version IRI (owl:versionIRI) had been added to this 1.0.2 version, in order to make RiC-O fully compliant with the OWL 2 specification as concerns ontology documents. 

**Version 1.1 introduces, in addition to some corrections and adjustments, several significant additions or modifications, the majority of which concern the properties of the rico:RecordResource class and/or its subclasses; other enhancements concern the properties of rico:Proxy, rico:Instantiation, rico:Date and rico:Relation classes**.

RiC-O 1.1 is **fully compliant with RiC-CM 1.0**, which is available in the corresponding repository [https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM).
               
The OWL/RDF file of RiC-O 1.1 is stored in the [ontology/current-version](./ontology/current-version) folder of this repository, with accompanying material, including a HTML version provided for human readers.
The repository also contains other resources, among which examples and diagrams.

**RiC-O 1.1 is also accessible to humans and machines through its IRI, [https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology](https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology)**.
