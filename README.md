# Records in Contexts-Ontology

This is the public GitHub repository that holds the source files on RiC-O OWL ontology.

ICA RiC-O (Records in Contexts-Ontology) is an OWL 2 ontology for describing archival record resources. As the second part of Records in Contexts (RiC) standard, it is a formal representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM).


The latest public release, RiC-O v0.2, dated February 12, 2021, can be found at [https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology](https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology). It is also available in the ontology/current-version folder.

This repo also contains examples and diagrams.

**The RiC-O development team has started to work on RiC-O 1.0**, that should be released in June 2023, along with RiC-CM 1.0. We are using the [https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/tree/version_1-0 branch](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/tree/version_1-0) to do so.
