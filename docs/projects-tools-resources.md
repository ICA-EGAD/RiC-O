Since RiC is a recent standard, there are still not so many concrete uses for it. In addition, RiC-CM and RiC-O are freely usable, so it is impossible to know all the uses. 

Since September 2021 when this page provided a list of early projects, **it has proven to be difficult for the RiC-O team to maintain an up-to-date list of projects by itself**. And this is far more difficult now: the projects already listed or known to us have evolved or will evolve, many other projects have started, contacting each of the teams we already know has already become complicated, and above all many other projects are not known to us.

**We thus have decided to replace this list with a list maintained collaboratively by the teams and people who take care of the projects or are interested in RiC**. 
This list also includes the RiC-CM based projects and bibliographic information about articles and other works related to RiC.

**This resource list has been available online since April 2025, at the following link:  [https://ica-egad.github.io/RiC-ResourceList](https://ica-egad.github.io/RiC-ResourceList)**.

We hope that you will find it useful, and will contribute by adding or editing resources! As is mentioned there, we are aware that the list is currently far from exhaustive. As is explained when one fills out the form for adding or editing resources, EGAD will moderate submissions before they go live.

If you have any suggestions regarding the site itself, or encounter any bugs, please use the 'Issues' tab at the GitHub repository for the site at the following link: [https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-ResourceList](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-ResourceList).

Also, feel free to get in touch with EGAD about this resource list via the [Records in Contexts users Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/Records_in_Contexts_users).
