Since RiC is a recent standard, there are still few concrete uses for it. In addition, RiC-CM and RiC-O are freely usable, so it is impossible to know all the uses. 

Since September 2021 when this page provided a list of early projects, it has proven to be difficult for the RiC-O team to maintain an up-to-date list of projects by itself. And this will be even more difficult now: the projects already listed or known to us have evolved or will evolve, many other projects have started, contacting each of the teams we already know has already become complicated, and above all many other projects are not known to us.

We thus have decided to replace this list with a list maintained collaboratively by the teams and people who take care of the projects or are interested in RiC. 
This list will also include the RiC-CM based projects and bibliographic information about articles and other works related to RiC.

To avoid complicating things, we plan to create a quite simple Google sheet in a folder accessible to all on Google Drive, and invite members of the "Records in Contexts users" group to fill out this file, giving key information about the projects and resources they know.

This Google sheet is not yet available. Meanwhile, you will find all discussions and information on this topic on the [Records in Contexts users Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/Records_in_Contexts_users).
