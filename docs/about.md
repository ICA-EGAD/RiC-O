RiC-O (Records in Contexts-Ontology) is **an OWL 2 ontology for describing archival record resources**. As **the third part of Records in Contexts (RiC) standard**, it is a formal representation of Records in Contexts Conceptual Model (RiC-CM).

RiC is the latest archival description standard, that makes it possible to describe archival records and the multiple layers of contexts in which they are inscribed through time, from their creation to their curation in an archival institution. It enables archivists and records managers to move forward, from the four previous ICA description standards (ISAD(G), ISAAR(CPF), ISDF and ISDIAH) to a more accurate, more nuanced, easier to process, multidimensional description.

RiC-O provides a generic vocabulary and formal rules for creating RDF datasets (or generating them from existing archival metadata) that describe in a consistent way any kind of archival record resource and its contextual entities. It is therefore a reference model for publishing archival metadata sets as Linked Data, querying them using SPARQL, and making inferences using the logic of the ontology.

Records in Contexts standard is developed by [International Council on Archives Expert Group on Archival Description (ICA EGAD)](https://www.ica.org/en/egad-steering-committee-0).

The **latest public release of RiC-O, RiC-O 1.0, was published in December 2023**. It is fully documented in English and available in the RiC-O GitHub repository, in the [current-version](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/tree/master/ontology/current-version) folder. It replaces RiC-O 0.2, which was released in February 2021.
RiC-O 1.0 comes with some [examples](examples.html) and [diagrams](diagrams.html). You will also find there the previous versions of the ontology. You can create or comment issues there.

RiC-O 1.0 is compliant with the **latest version of Records in Contexts-Conceptual Model (RiC-CM), RiC-CM 1.0, which was released in November 2023** and is available for download [here](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM/releases/tag/v1.0), or [here](https://www.ica.org/app/uploads/2023/12/RiC-CM-1.0.pdf).
