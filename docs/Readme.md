This is **the official website on ICA EGAD Records in Contexts-Ontology (ICA RiC-O)**. It is an HTML version of the documentation that was prepared about the ontology and whose sources are in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O). It also provides useful links to the other contents of this repository.

The **latest public release of RiC-O, RiC-O 1.0**, is dated December 30, 2023. You can find it in the GitHub repository, and in the latest release.

It will be available to machines and human readers through its IRI (https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology) as soon as the ICA website has been migrated to a new site.

RiC-O 1.0 is **based on the latest version of Records in Contexts-Conceptual Model (RiC-CM), RiC-CM 1.0, which was  released on November 30, 2023**, and which is available for download [here](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-CM/releases/tag/v1.0), or [here](https://www.ica.org/app/uploads/2023/12/RiC-CM-1.0.pdf).
