This is **the official website on ICA EGAD Records in Contexts-Ontology (ICA RiC-O)**. It is an HTML version of the documentation that was prepared about the ontology and whose sources are in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O). It also provides useful links to the other contents of this repository.

The **latest public release of RiC-O, RiC-O 0.2**, is dated February 12, 2021.

**It is available here:
[https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology](https://www.ica.org/standards/RiC/ontology).**

It is **based on the latest version of Records in Contexts-Conceptual Model (RiC-CM), RiC-CM 0.2. RiC-CM 0.2 was released in July 2021 along with a call for comments** (see [the announcement](https://www.ica.org/en/public-release-of-records-in-contexts-conceptual-model-02)).

RiC-CM 0.2 is available here: 
[https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/ric-cm-02_july2021_0.pdf](https://www.ica.org/sites/default/files/ric-cm-02_july2021_0.pdf).

**The RiC-O development team has started to work on RiC-O 1.0**, that should be released in June 2023, along with RiC-CM 1.0. We are using the [https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/tree/version_1-0 branch](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/tree/version_1-0) to do so.

**If you want to contact us, or send comments and questions, you can use the new [Records in Contexts users Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/Records_in_Contexts_users)**.
