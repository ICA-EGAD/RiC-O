Since RiC is a recent standard, and remains a draft (version 1.0 will be released at the end of 2021), there are still few concrete uses for it. In addition, RiC-CM and RiC-O are freely usable, so it is impossible to know all the uses. The list below has been drawn up on the basis of a survey carried out mainly among all members of the EGAD group. We invite people with knowledge of other projects to contact us ([egad at ica.org](mailto:egad@ica.org)) to have them listed.


## Proofs of concept and research programs

In **Belgium**, representatives of the State Archives, Libis-KU Leuven (the department responsible for IT solutions and developments at the Catholic University Leuven), KBR (the Royal Library of Belgium), the Royal Museums of Art and History and a private company joined their forces to carry out a proof of concept. **The aim is to explore, using RiC-CM and RiC-O as the main conceptual model and ontology, the feasibility of transforming into an entity graph and interconnecting a consequent selection of heterogeneous metadata sets from the partner institutions, then to assess the implications and benefits of this development, for these institutions and for the end users**. The partners of the project, called RICFAIRData, are working further on the project and are seeking for structural funding.

As part of her **doctoral thesis in information and communication from the Université libre de Bruxelles on “La gestion des données d’autorité archivistiques dans le cadre du Web de données"** ("The management of archival authority data within the framework of the Linked Data web"), available at [http://hdl.handle.net/2013/ULB-DIPOT:oai:dipot.ulb.ac.be:2013/315804](http://hdl.handle.net/2013/ULB-DIPOT:oai:dipot.ulb.ac.be:2013/315804), defended in December 2020, Anne Chardonnens set up, for the CegeSoma research center (Study and Documentation Centre War and Contemporary Society) at the State Archives of Belgium, a first version of a Wikibase knowledge base, for the management of authority data coming from heterogeneous resources and relating to people linked to the Second World War. This prototype is available at [https://adochs.arch.be](https://adochs.arch.be). Like any Wikibase instance, it is searchable using the SPARQL protocol and exposes the data in RDF. In the context of this work, its author established **mappings between the properties of this knowledge base, the Wikidata properties and RiC-O properties** (see the appendix 6 of the thesis).

The **Atlantic Slave Trade on Linked Open Archives research project** of the LABOGAD laboratory (Laboratório de Preservação e Gestão de Acervos Digitais) of the State University of Rio de Janeiro in **Brazil** aims to interconnect and publish, using the semantic technologies and RiC-O, archival metadata sets describing documents relating to the Atlantic slave trade, kept in Brazil, then subsequently in Angola and Portugal.

In **Germany**, RiC-O is being used as a source of inspiration for the ambitious **SoNAR (IDH) re-search project** (Interfaces to Data for Historical Social Network Analysis and Research; [https://sonar.fh-potsdam.de/](https://sonar.fh-potsdam.de/)), for the creation of the generic graph model which is at the heart of the prototype under construction. 

## Current and future implementations in archival information systems


In **France** :
- The **French Archival Portal (FranceArchives, [https://francearchives.fr/](https://francearchives.fr/)) has chosen RiC-O as the reference ontology for its future RDF web app**. The portal’s governing board made this decision following a precise and independent study carried out by a company specializing in the semantic web, Logilab, which developed the first version of the portal and is responsible for developing its version 2. The target is to 'make FranceArchives a reference repository for French archives within the Linked Data Web'. The study includes a comparative analysis of several ontologies. Among the elements that led Logilab to choose RiC-O:
    - it is more precise and richer than the other ontologies studied (among which LOCAH and EDM) and allows archival resources to be represented in detail, keeping the structure and information that can be found in EAD documents. It also keeps the expressiveness and structure of the entities of the EAC-CPF format.
    - it is maintained and its authors can be contacted.
    - some French examples exist, as well as some first mappings (EAD to RiC-O and EAC-CPF to RiC-O) within the documentation of the free RiC-O Converter software.
    
It will probably take the FranceArchives team two years to develop the web application and all the tools and workflow needed for producing and maintaining the RDF datasets.
    
- At the Archives nationales (ANF) ([http://www.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/](http://www.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/)): **the ANF first built a qualitative proof of concept, with two other institutions, the French National Libray (BnF) and a subdivision of the French ministry of Culture (the Service ministériel des Archives de France, SIAF), and a private company (Logilab)**. The target was to demonstrate that it is possible to convert existing archival metadata sets into RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O (in 2017-2018 it was an early version of the ontology), to interconnect the RDF datasets coming from several institutions and to explore and visualize them using new methods. The proof of concept, named **PIAAF** (Pilote d’Interopérabilité pour les Autorités archivistiques françaises) was released in February 2018 ([https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr](https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr)), with a tutorial, and a report on the methodology followed and outcomes. Not only were the results obtained of high quality but the partners were also able to assess the improvement this solution offers in terms of accuracy and search possibilities. The next step is going on. It consists on **moving to a far larger scale**, first **converting the whole of the ANF existing archival metadata (finding aids, authority records and vocabularies) to RDF conforming to RiC-O and SKOS**. Another task consists of **enriching the existing authority data and vocabularies**, mainly by aligning them with other datasets and by extracting information from the existing finding aids (named entities recognition, and resolution, developing and using a machine learning tool) and databases on personal files. This ongoing work mainly concerns the data on the agents and places. Other **new authority records and vocabularies are also being created**, e.g. one on place types and one on the agents’ activities, which should play a key role in the future. Another series of projects tries to answer to the following question: what exactly would it change for the end users, if an archival institution uses RDF/RiC-O datasets and Linked Data technologies for its online information system? The ANF are exploring some leads through several projects, along with several partners. One of them is a specific research project, ALEGORIA ([http://alegoria.ign.fr/en](http://alegoria.ign.fr/en)). ALEGORIA is lead by the Institut Géographique National, and aims to build a web platform where several large, digitized (or born digital) collections of aerial photographs of the French territory dated 1950-1980, among which two collections from the ANF, will be gathered, made searchable using both an RDF search engine (querying their RDF/RiC-O metadata) and artificial intelligence tools (enabling to search and index their content), and displayed through an immersive interface. Another project aims to enhance the [Sparnatural visual SPARQL query builder](http://sparnatural.eu/) and to build a demonstrator using Sparnatural on a significant amount of the ANF RDF/RiC-O metadata.
    
All this work fits more broadly into the strategic plan of the National Archives for the years 2021-2025. It is closely linked to metadata quality improvement programs, and to actions aiming to break down the barriers between the internal metadata repositories, to build shared authority data. The final target is to publish the ANF RDF/RiC-O metadata sets as Linked Open Data.

- At the French National Library (BnF): the [2020-2024 roadmap](https://data.bnf.fr/fr/roadmap) of the BnF Linked Data web application, [data.bnf.fr](https://data.bnf.fr/en/), includes the integration of RiC-O, in order to better represent the metadata coming from the institution's [Archives and Manuscripts Database (BAM)](https://archivesetmanuscrits.bnf.fr/).

In **the Netherlands**, the **Amsterdam City Archives** ([https://amsterdam.nl/stadsarchief](https://amsterdam.nl/stadsarchief)) is working together with developer Picturae (https://picturae.com/en/) in **developing a new version of its collection management system called Memorix, based on Linked Data. The City Archives uses RiC-O to turn its descriptive metadata into Linked Open Data**, a step-by-step process. The City Archives publishes about RiC and the status of the implementation on its website (Dutch only): [https://www.amsterdam.nl/stadsarchief/organisatie/blog-bronnen-bytes/](https://www.amsterdam.nl/stadsarchief/organisatie/blog-bronnen-bytes/).

In **Switzerland**, a **new version of the Memobase portal ([http://memobase.ch](http://memobase.ch)) was released in May 2021**. This portal, a flagship achievement of **Memoriav**, the Association for the Safeguarding of Swiss Audiovisual Memory, aggregates metadata on the audiovisual archives of more than 80 Swiss organizations. The University Library Basel ([https://ub.unibas.ch/](https://ub.unibas.ch/)) and docuteam company ([https://www.docuteam.ch/fr/](https://www.docuteam.ch/fr/)) were commissioned to produce the new version of Memobase, **whose data model uses RiC-O (for descriptive metadata)**, and the more specialized ontologies (PREMIS, [http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/ontology/index.html](http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/ontology/index.html); and Ebucore, [https://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/](https://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/)) for the technical metadata of audiovisual documents.

In the **United States of America**, the Social Networks and Archival Context Cooperative (SNAC) ([https://snaccooperative.org/](https://snaccooperative.org/)) **plans to implement a subset of RiC-O primarily focused on the description of Agents (corporate bodies, persons, and families), Activity, Place, and Record Resource**. SNAC emphasizes the description of Agents in providing essential context for discovery and understanding Record Resources. The descriptions of Agents in SNAC are detailed, the descriptions of Record Resources are summary descriptions with links to full descriptions in the catalogs of holding repositories. In anticipation of exposing a subset of SNAC description using RiC-O, work is underway to **revise the Relations in SNAC to conform to RiC-O though extending the Relations with more specific classes** to accomodate more detailed description of Agent identities. For example SNAC will use the Relations "is identity place of" and "is ancestry place of" as subclasses of "is associated with place". When the work is completed, the SNAC social-document network or graph will be exposed as a SPARQL endpoint.


## Tools

The Archives nationales de **France** (ANF) and a small private company ([Sparna](http://www.sparna.fr/)) have developed a free software, **RiC-O Converter**, for converting into RDF datasets conforming to RiC-O 0.1 the whole of the ANF EAD 2002 findings aids (about 29.000 XML files for now) and EAC-CPF authority records (about 15.000 XML files for now). This tool is easy to install and use, fast and efficient. **Its source code and documentation, that include mappings between EAD and EAC-CPF, and RiC-O** were made available on GitHub in April 2020: see [https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter](https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter). You can also **download RiC-O Converter v1.0 release** from here: [https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter/releases](https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR/rico-converter/releases). A version 2.0 of RiC-O Converter will be released in 2021, which will be compliant with RiC-O 0.2.

Under the aegis of the Access To Memory foundation ([https://accesstomemoryfoundation.org/](https://accesstomemoryfoundation.org/)), which was created in 2018 with the aim of supervising and financing the development of a version 3 of the free software AtOM and which brings together about thirty archives, libraries and universities in America, Europe and Australia, the company **Artefactual Systems**, main developer of the software, and **docuteam**, are working on the **development of AtOM 3, which will include a SPARQL endpoint publishing RiC-O compliant archival metadata sets**.

The Swiss company **docuteam** is currently developing, with the company **Zazuko** ([http://zazuko.com/](http://zazuko.com/)), a **software prototype for the description of archives, which uses semantic technologies, and RiC-O and PREMIS as reference ontologies**.
