The following is an overview of RiC-O roadmap and schedule for 2024.

Of course, **the schedule also depends on RiC-O users, on their comments, expectations and proposals**. RiC-O users now can use the public GitHub repository to create issues or comment existing issues, and also fork it and create pull requests from a fork. **A big "thank you" to all the people who, outside the ICA/EGAD group, already contributed to the development of RiC-O 1.0, through their requests, their comments, their advice or their help**.

You can also simply contact us and send comments and questions, using either ([egad at ica.org mailbox](mailto:egad@ica.org), or the new ['Records in Contexts users' Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/Records_in_Contexts_users) discussion list.

The following is a non exhaustive list of known topics or tasks on which EGAD has begun to work and will continue to work in the next months. We will update and enrich it, and will of course create issues so that more information is available on what we are doing.

- add more examples and diagrams to the GitHub repository;
- add suggestions of mappings (in rico:closeTo) and OWL equivalences between some classes or properties and components in other models (among which - this is not an exhaustive list- PREMIS, Schema.org, PROV-O, IFLA-LRM and RDA, CIDOC-CRM), or document how these models can be used together.
- articulate the Event and Activity classes, and the Relation system of classes.
- enrich the two existing vocabularies on Documentary Form Types and Record Set Types, and develop other ones, e.g. on Event/Activity Types.
