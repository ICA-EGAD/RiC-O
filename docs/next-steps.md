The following is an overview of RiC-O roadmap and schedule for 2020 and 2021.

Of course, **the schedule also depends on RiC-O users, on their comments, expectations and proposals**. RiC-O users now can use the public GitHub repository to create issues, and also fork it and create pull requests from a fork. 

You can also simply contact us and send comments and questions, using either ([egad at ica.org mailbox](mailto:egad@ica.org), or RiC-O users discussion list. If you would like to subscribe to the RiC-O discussion list, simply email to Florence Clavaud ([florence.clavaud at culture.gouv.fr](mailto:florence.clavaud@culture.gouv.fr)).

The global schedule is the following:

* **preparing and releasing RiC 0.2**. Apart from fixing the possibly remaining bugs in 0.1, this will mainly imply making RiC-O compliant with RiC-CM 0.2. In this CM version, some definitions of the already existing components have changed. A few additions have also be done. **This has been done: RiC-O 0.2 was released in February 2021.** The issues and pull requests made in the GitHub repository provide more information on the main changes. The internal documentation of RiC-0 0.2 also includes a detailed history note (see the ontology metadata); besides, any change in the definition of a class or property, since December 2019, is documented in the ontology file, using a skos:changeNote property in the description of the resource updated.
* **preparing and releasing RiC-0 1.0**. This version will not be a draft, but the first official recommendation. **It will be released in 2022 or by the beginning of 2023**, along with RiC-CM 1.0.

The following is a non exhaustive list of topics, tasks and known issues on which EGAD RiC-O development team will work in the next months, the milestone being RiC-O 1.0:

* adding more examples and diagrams to the GitHub repository;
* defining more accurately some properties (as transitive, functional, inverse functional...); possibly adding some transitive properties;
* finishing the system of relations (where some subclasses are still missing);
* articulating the Event and Activity classes, and the Relation system of classes;
* providing mappings between the components of RiC-O, and the components of the EAD and EAC-CPF XML schemata that archivists use for producing or exchanging finding aids and authority records conforming to the ICA previous standards (ISAD(G) and ISAAR(CPF);
* adding suggestions of mappings (in rico:closeTo) and OWL equivalences between some classes or properties and components in other models (among which - this is not an exhaustive list- CIDOC-CRM, IFLA-LRM, PREMIS, PROV-O, and Schema.org).
