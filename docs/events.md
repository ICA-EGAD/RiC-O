Just like for the projects and tools, it is difficult for the RiC-O team to maintain an up-to-date list of events about RiC-O by itself. 

The best place where you can find information about events and presentations is the [Records in Contexts users Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/Records_in_Contexts_users) list.

You will nevertheless find, below, the list that had been established about events dated from the end of 2019 to September 2021.

Let us also mention the **international study day on the first implementations of RiC, which took place on November 15, 2023** at the Archives nationales de France. This day brought together around 750 people on site and online. The [program](https://www.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/documents/10157/294803/15112023_prog_records.pdf/) reflects the diversity and number of projects in progress, and may help to get a global, of course not exhaustive, overview of what is going on about RiC-O in archival institutions and elsewhere. The slides are now available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zywJxTuccDjSX-QUrYc4deACs_BTw9z8?usp=drive_link). The video recording is also available on the Archives nationales de France channel on Dailymotion, [in the form of a playlist](https://www.dailymotion.com/playlist/x86ajs). These resources are also referenced in the list mentioned on page [projects-tools-resources.html](projects-tools-resources.html).

## Events from 2019 to 2021

Note that the resources listed below may now be obsolete.

* On **November 22, 2019**, the Adochs project organised an international study day on Linked Data at KBR (the Royal Library of **Belgium**), whose program is available [here](https://www.kbr.be/en/agenda/linking-the-past/). While morning presentations tackled new models, those of afternoon presented several case studies on publishing archival data as Linked Data. The first presentation on RiC-CM 0.2 and RiC-O 0.1 took place there. The slides are not available online any more.
* On **January 28, 2020**, a conference named **"_Les métadonnées archivistiques en transition : le nouveau cadre normatif, les enjeux et les premières réalisations_" (in English: "_Archival metadata in transition: the new description standard, the challenges and first achievments_")** took place at the Archives nationales de **France** (ANF). The slides used for each presentation can be downloaded from [here](https://labarchiv.hypotheses.org/1495). The [slides about RiC](https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2167/files/2020/02/20200128_2_RecordsInContexts_englishVersionAdded1003.pdf) are bilingual (French and English). 
* On **February 3, 2021**, there was a presentation on 'Implementing ICA Records in Contexts-Ontology (RiC-O) at the National Archives of France (ANF): first steps and prospects' at the **[Study Day on The Semantic Web and Cultural Heritage: From Data Convergence to Knowledge Crossing](https://geriico.univ-lille.fr/detail-event/le-web-semantique-et-le-patrimoine-culturel-de-la-convergence-des-donnees-au-croisement-des-connaissances)** held by the University of Lille (France) and the Geriico research team. The slides (in English) are available here: [https://nextcloud.univ-lille.fr/index.php/s/L9xjpD9PBRfQj7H](https://nextcloud.univ-lille.fr/index.php/s/L9xjpD9PBRfQj7H).
* On **September 13, 2021**, there was a presentation on RiC-O by Florence Clavaud and Tobias Wildi, and other presentations about some projects that use RiC-O or RiC, or plan to use RiC-O, at the **[Linked Archives international workshop @ TPDL 2021](https://linkedarchives21.inesctec.pt/)**. The web page of the workshop gives access to the slides, and to the proceedings ([articles in English](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZoYjBCdjOqUZddgBRhWeEeDY-MHwjy8/view?usp=sharing)).
