The following is a list of past and future events on RiC-O, from the end of 2019, and of presentations on RiC-O that are now available online.

* On **November 22, 2019**, the Adochs project organised an **[international study day on Linked Data](http://adochs.be/linking/)** at KBR (the Royal Library of **Belgium**). While morning presentations tackled new models, those of afternoon presented several case studies on publishing archival data as Linked Data. The first presentation on RiC-CM 0.2 and RiC-O 0.1 took place there. The [slides on RiC, written in English](http://adochs.be/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LinkingThePast_Brussels_20191122_RecordsInContexts.pdf), are less detailed about the standard than the ones mentioned below; however they include some information about the projects lead by the Archives nationales de France.
* On **January 28, 2020**, a conference named **"_Les métadonnées archivistiques en transition : le nouveau cadre normatif, les enjeux et les premières réalisations_" (in English: "_Archival metadata in transition: the new description standard, the challenges and first achievments_")** took place at the Archives nationales de **France** (ANF). The slides used for each presentation can be downloaded from [here](https://labarchiv.hypotheses.org/1495). The [slides about RiC](https://f.hypotheses.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/2167/files/2020/02/20200128_2_RecordsInContexts_englishVersionAdded1003.pdf) are bilingual (French and English). 
* On **February 3, 2021**, there was a presentation on 'Implementing ICA Records in Contexts-Ontology (RiC-O) at the National Archives of France (ANF): first steps and prospects' at the **Study Day on The Semantic Web and Cultural Heritage: From Data Convergence to Knowledge Crossing** held by the University of Lille (France) and the Geriico research team (see [https://geriico.univ-lille.fr/detail-event/le-web-semantique-et-le-patrimoine-culturel-de-la-convergence-des-donnees-au-croisement-des-connai/](https://geriico.univ-lille.fr/detail-event/le-web-semantique-et-le-patrimoine-culturel-de-la-convergence-des-donnees-au-croisement-des-connai/)).
