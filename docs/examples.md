The RiC-O GitHub repository includes **some example files**.

You can find them [there](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/tree/master/examples/examples_v1-0).

For now, they consist of **existing, "real world", archival metadata sets (all of them being EAD, EAC-CPF or METS files), and their RDF/RiC-O version**. All have been prepared by ICA EGAD. 


They come along with:

* a few introductory notes for each set (in Readme files), including some warnings on the fact that the files are not to be considered uptodate nor representative;
* a CC BY 4.0 license;
* some additional files, e.g. screenshots of some parts of the graphs obtained, and as soon as possible, examples of SPARQL queries you can use on these RDF datasets.



If you have some examples, or would like to discuss testing RiC-O on a small subset of your own archival metadata and give free access to the outcomes, contact us ([egad at ica.org](mailto:egad@ica.org))!
