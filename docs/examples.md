The RiC-O GitHub repository includes **some example files**.

You can find them [there](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/tree/master/examples/examples_v1-1).

For now, they consist of **existing, "real world", archival metadata sets (all of them being EAD, EAC-CPF or METS files), and their RDF/RiC-O version**. All have been prepared by ICA EGAD. 


They come along with:

* a few introductory notes for each set (in Readme files), including some warnings on the fact that the files are not to be considered uptodate nor representative;
* a CC BY 4.0 license;
* some additional files, e.g. screenshots of some parts of the graphs obtained.


If you have some examples, or would like to discuss testing RiC-O on a small subset of your own archival metadata and give free access to the outcomes, contact us ([egad at ica.org](mailto:egad@ica.org))!
