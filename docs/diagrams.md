EGAD has begun to draw some **diagrams**, hoping that they can help understanding RiC-O as a domain ontology.

You can find them [here](https://github.com/ICA-EGAD/RiC-O/tree/master/diagrams).

They may concern **the ontology itself**. They also may concern **real world examples**; in such a case, they represent small graphs (or an overview of them) produced from some existing archival metadata. 

The diagrams folder now mainly includes diagrams about RiC-O 0.1 And RiC-0 0.2.

The diagrams are under a [CC BY 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

All of them for now have been designed using [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/), a free online diagram software. The GitHub repo therefore includes, for each diagram, the XML source file and a JPEG screenshot. If you want to edit a diagram once pulled into your local repository, just open the XML source file in Draw.io! 

If you have some diagrams and would like to share them, just contact us ([egad at ica.org](mailto:egad@ica.org))! We can either list them in this web page and provide a link to your own project or institution repository, or include these diagrams into the GitHub RiC-O repository.
