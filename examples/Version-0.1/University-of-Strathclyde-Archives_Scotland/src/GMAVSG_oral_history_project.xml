        <p>The Greater Manchester Asbestos Victims Support Group is a registered charity which
          provides support to people with asbestos-related diseases and their families. In Britain,
          asbestos is typically associated with Britain's tradition of heavy industry, due to its
          widespread use in power stations, shipbuilding, factories, and dockyards, but asbestos was
          also used in the construction of a wide variety of building types, including shops and
          schools.</p>

      <p> Oral history project, conducted in 2014-2015 by Nigel Ingham of the Open University on
        behalf of the Greater Manchester Asbestos Victims Support Group, interviewing members of the
        Group. <lb/>
        <lb/> There were 7 interviews in total and the collection comprises audio recordings, full
        transcripts, summaries and photographs for all interviews. <lb/>
        <lb/> The interviewees comprise 5 women, widowed through mesothelioma (an asbestos-related
        disease), and 2 men who at the time were current sufferers. Of the 5 widows, 3 had been
        bereaved for up to 10 years, while two others lost their respective loved ones in the
        previous 12 months. <lb/>
        <lb/> The interviews cover life story details, the social and economic context in which
        asbestos exposure occurred, the patient journey with mesothelioma, as well as the
        individual, emotional, family and social impact of the disease. Heavy industries such as
        textile mills, power stations are featured in the material, as well as shops, schools, and
        other 'lighter' contexts. The trades of those exposed to asbestos include electrical
        engineering, painting and decorating, joinery, shopfitting, bricklaying and tiling. <lb/>
        <lb/> Geographically, the material predominantly covers Lancashire and Greater Manchester,
        but also references London. <lb/>
        <lb/> Temporally, the material covers the decades following World War II up to approximately
        2015. </p>
