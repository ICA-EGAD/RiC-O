# Example EAD 2002 files

Date of this example set: May 2025

Language(s) used: French

This folder contains 17 finding aids that conform to ICA ISAD(G) standard and are encoded in XML/EAD2002. They describe record sets held by the Archives nationales de France (ANF) and created by agents whose EAC-CPF description can often be found in the sibling input-eac folder.

These source files have been published online. You can access an HTML version of these files at [https://www.siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr](https://www.siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr). The only official, uptodate version of the source files is to be found there.

If you want to access an HTML version (then a PDF version, + the latest version of the EAD source file) of one of the finding aids, type its permalink, using the following pattern: https://www.siv.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/siv/IR/{FA_Id}, where '{FA_Id]' is the name of the EAD file (and the value of the /ead/eadheader/eadid element in the file).

These source files are provided as example files but __do not represent the variety of the about 32.000 finding aids that the ANF have created and manage__, or always conform to the local best practice as recommended in the application guidelines used in the ANF. They have been chosen because they are linked to the EAC-CPF files also provided, and because an earlier version of most of them was used for the French RDF/RiC proof of concept released in February 2018 ([PIAAF](https://piaaf.demo.logilab.fr)).
