            WARNING: This
            version is an incomplete version, which will be followed by other beta versions till the files can be considered quite complete and can be released publicly. 
            RiC-O, like RiC-CM v0.2 to which it conforms, is
            still a work in progress and many components of it are still unstable. 
            Main current limits: 
            - top level hierarchies of classes and properties to be reviewed, checked and enhanced 
            - naming conventions to be accurately defined and applied
            - formal constraints not complete 
            - documentation is partial 
            - no alignments made yet 
            - not yet fully tested (though several projects, including large ones, have been using and are using RiC-O, particularly in the Archives nationales de France).</owl:versionInfo>

        <skos:historyNote xml:lang="en">Previous version, dated May 2018, has been updated as
            concerns many aspects: 
            - class system made compliant with the current, not finished,
            version of RiC-CM (v2); particularly, several classes have been renamed, some have been
            added (Action, Process, SingleDate, DateRange, DateSet); Position is now a subclass of
            Agent 
            - same for data and object properties, including the system of n-ary relations;
            lot of properties added, some removed 
            - some classes and properties added for handling
            Places (PhysicalLocation and GeographicalCoordinates) and dates (TimeAppellation) 
            - reviewed the list and names of object properties for n-ary relations (in particular, new
            top level properties created: relationConnects, relationHasSource, relationHasTarget;
            names of properties include &quot;hasTarget&quot;, &quot;hasSource&quot;,
            &quot;isSourceOf&quot;, or &quot;isTargetOf&quot;, or &quot;connects&quot;. 
            - formal definition of classes created (but remains not finished) 
            - minimal documentation for classes added (using rdfs:label; rdfs:comment; skos:scopeNote. Skos:note contains
            current questions and comments for RiC-O development team) 
            - some metadata added about the ontology itself and about the SKOS vocabulary on record set types, including a
            versionInfo note (that contains a warning) and a CC-BY license. 
            On October 31, version reviewed and some details updated : created CarrierType, ProductionTechniqueType,
            OccupationType, OccupationRelation and the object properties needed to define or use
            them; re-introduced some data properties needed for enabling current archival metadata
            to be converted easily to RDF: source, identifier, title, height, width. 
            On December 7, a few changes made when needed for handling ANF data : changed the domain for state
            property, added isWithin object property. 
On 2019, February 22-26, main changes : 
- renamed Function &gt; Purpose
- renamed some object properties (has Date &gt; isAssociatedWithDate, hasPlace &gt; isAssociatedWithPlace), renamed LocationRelation to RelationToPlace, removed LeadesrhipRelation under AgentMembershipRelation, and also cleaned the shortcut personIsMemberOf.
Added hasDerivedRecordResource and wasMigratedInto object properties (and their inverse ones).
Renamed RegulationRelation &gt; RelationToRule; CategorizationRelation &gt; RelationToType. 
Moved hasSender and hasAddresse under hasOrigination
Occupation is now a subclass of Activity ; pursues a subproperty of realizes
OccupationRelation is a subclass of ActivityRealizationRelation
Added FunctionalEquivalenceRelation under RecordResourceRelation, + the object properties needed

March 8 : introduced a &quot;state&quot; data property, and made relationState and RecordResourceState subproperties of it
Fixed some inconsistencies in the relation system of classes and properties

March 19: history data property fixed (it is not a functional property)
April 29: hasSource has no range any more; added usedFromDate and usedToDate properties ; changed agentIsSourceOfHierarchicalRelation to AgentIsSourceOfAgentHierarchicalRelation, same for the inverse relation ; reviewed the OriginationRelation class and properties system
May 21: changed personIsSourceOfSubordinationRelation to personIsSourceOfAgentSubordinationRelation (and same for the related properties)

June 27: 
- changed the definition of Rule, made Mandate a subclass of Rule and changed its definition; created the RelationToMandate class and the needed object properties. 
- replaced &apos;occuredAt&apos; by &apos;isAssociatedWithPlace&apos; in the definition of the Relation class
- on the root element, replaced xmlns:ontology=&quot;rico:&quot; by xmlns:rico=&quot;rico:&quot;

July 22-August 6:
- introduced the Instantiation class, InstantiationRelation and RecordResourceRepresentationRelation classes, and every data and object property needed for handling these new classes. Which implied to make some changes in the definition of RecordResource and RecordResourceRelation.
        
September 19: towards a beta version of v0-1 draft : 
- Removed importing SKOS.
- RecordSetType, LegalStatus, CarrierType, ProductionTechniqueType are no longer subclasses of skos:Concept.
- removed Action, Purpose and Process classes and all the properties concerned. Renamed ActivityRealizationRelation to PerformanceRelation (and other changes concerning the object properties). Updated the annotations properties of Activity
- Activity made a subclass of Event
- removed, under Agent, all the classes that corresponded dicrectly to some DULCE-DNS classes. Updated the definitions of the remaining classes
- removed SocialIdentity class and SocialIdentityType + the properties concerned
        
September 20 : 
- removed ActivityDomain  and RelationType (and the properties concerned)
- renamed TimeAppellation &gt; DateAppellation
- renamed Role &gt; RoleType, and moved it to Type
- fixed the label of Instantiation

September 25: fixed the domain of encodingFormat (changed to Instantiation) ; removed ConceptAppellation class

November 14-15: began to make RiC-O compliant with RiC-CM v0.2. Done for the majority of the classes and data properties. Created a CMcorrespondingComponent annotation property, subproperty of skos:note, for mapping RiC-O components to RiC-CM when appliable. Added a &apos;usability&apos; skos:scopeNote on some data properties for specifying they are to be used only if the corresponding classes and object properties cannot be used.</skos:historyNote>

        <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Activity is a kind of Event.

Activity is specifically used to designate purposeful human activity. 

Activity may be understood from two perspectives. First it can be understood as leading to an end. The end is the purpose of the Activity, or why the Activity is performed. Second, it can be understood in terms of the processes that lead to achieving the end, how the end is realized through coordinated actions.

Purpose and process are complementary understandings of Activity. Together the two perspectives address why the Activity is performed, the expected ends or outcomes; and how the Activity fulfills the purpose. 

While activity has an intended end, there are also unintended consequences, results not intended, or side-effects. By and large, these may not be the focus of the description, but they are, unquestionably, context. 

In a corporate or government context an Activity may also be called a function. 

An Activity exists in a specific social and cultural context, and within that context is subject to change over time. 

An Activity may be composed of other Activities.</skos:scopeNote>

            Group commonly has one identity, though each also may have one or more alternative
            identities. Such alternative identities may be shared by more than one Person or Group.
            Alternative identities include but are not limited to pseudonyms, heteronyms, DBA (Doing
            Business As), and trade identities. An alternative identity should not be confused with
            a Position in a Group, for example, presidents, prime ministers, governors, popes,
            royalty, or bishops. Nor should an alternative identity be confused with a variant name
            or identifier of the same identity. Agent also includes entities created by a Person or
            Group that act on behalf of the creating Agent in an autonomous or semi-autonomous
            manner. Examples of such Mechanisms are software agents, robots, and space and

- LODE Event class (2010)
            (http://linkedevents.org/ontology/#term-Event) – with some important details in the
            definition: “An event consists of some temporal and spatial boundaries subjectively
            imposed on the flux of reality or imagination, that we wish to treat as an entity for
            the purposes of making statements about it. In particular, we may wish to make
            statements that relate people, places, or things to an event. Note that, unlike some
            definitions of &quot;event,&quot; this definition does not specify that an event
            involves a change of state, nor does it attempt to distinguish events from processes or
            states”.
 - Event in the Event ontology (2007) (http://motools.sf.net/event/event.html) -
            The Event class in BIO: A vocabulary for biographical information
            (http://purl.org/vocab/bio/0.1/Event). 
- IFLA-LRM has no Event entity (but quotes event
            as a category of E1 Res entity)
 - CIDOC-CRM has a more precise definition of Event (E5
            Event, subclass of Period, superclass of Activity, Beginning of Existence and End of
            Existence) : “This class comprises changes of states in cultural, social or physical
            systems, regardless of scale, brought about by a series or group of coherent physical,
            cultural, technological or legal phenomena. Such changes of state will affect instances
            of E77 Persistent Item or its subclasses. The distinction between an E5 Event and an E4
            Period is partly a question of the scale of observation. 
QUESTIONS: - are some relations
            (or all relations &quot;in between&quot;) to be considered also as events? e.g. :
            production, authorship, authorizing, ... - see also DOLCE-DNS</skos:note>
        <skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Event</skos:prefLabel>
        <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">An event may be natural, human, or a combination of natural and human. Events have temporal and spatial boundaries.  It may actively involve some agent(s) and affect any primary entity. 

An event may be discrete, happening at a specific moment in time, or may occur over an extended period of time. Events may have events as parts, and events may precede or follow one another. Multiple agents may participate in the same event, and in different roles.

It may be useful or necessary to use Event entity:



- when the history of an entity has to be accurately taken into account.
One may thus decide to pick out some of the events of that history, for example those who affect the entity and change its state or environment, and to describe them so that this description can be processed.
In such a case the Event entity will connect several entities. For example, a creation Event may connect a Record, a DateRange, a Place, an Agent.
- in order to specify that a Record, Record Set or Record Part has an Event as subject.

Some things that happen and that actively involve agents may be considered either Events or Actions, depending whether they are viewed as contextual entities or whether the focus is on the records that may result from it, in short depending on the perspective adopted when describing them.

An Event may be categorized using an Event Type entity (a secondary controlled concept entity) (which means that we should add this Event Type entity in the list of controlled concept entities; or do we only quote and define the Activity concept ?). 

In particular, archivists, records managers and end users may need to use some main event categories concerning either the history of record resources, either the life of agents, for classifying, thus grouping and searching events. Examples include curation events (creation, accumulation, acquisition, transfer, arrangement, description, digitization, deletion…) and biographical events (birth, marriage, death…), or events in the existence of corporate bodies (creation, merger…).</skos:scopeNote>

“Family” is used here as a general term that encompasses a wide variety of familial groups. Other types of familial groups include Dynasty, Clan, House, Tribe and others. 

Though family may be a recognized legal group in specific contexts, the term may also be used for groups that are socially recognized as families. A family may be a group of persons related either by consanguinity or affinity or cohabitation or other social conventions. 

In some context, a Family may be a legally recognized as Corporate Body. For example, certain North American peoples  (tribes) retain self-government rights and have jurisdiction over defined tribal lands.

This entity includes:
- Familiar units, clans, houses…
- Dynasties, lineages, royal houses, nobiliary houses…
- Owners or holders of a title of nobility.
- Historical or current families.
- Families that manage records.</skos:scopeNote>

First attempt for a definition: The physical representation, manifestation, of (the message conveyed by) a Record Resource.
A Record Resource may have many Instantiations simultaneously or through time.
A Record or Record Part must have been instantiated at least once, though this instantiation may no longer exist.
A Record Set may have an instantiation, which is to say that it is not a necessary condition.
An Instantiation may be derived from another Instantiation.</skos:definition>

        <skos:note xml:lang="en">See PREMIS Representation : &quot;A digital or physical Object instantiating or embodying an Intellectual Entity. A digital representation is the set of stored digital files and structural metadata needed to provide a complete and reasonable rendition of the Intellectual Entity. A physical representation is an item such as a manuscript, video cassette, or printed document.&quot;
Intellectual entity : &quot;A set of content that is considered a single intellectual unit for purposes of management and description: for example, a particular book, map, photograph, database, or piece of hardware or software. An Intellectual Entity can include other Intellectual Entities; for example, a web site can include a web page; a web page can include an image. An Intellectual Entity may have one or more digital representations.&quot;
Intellectual entity is close to RiC-CM Record Resource</skos:note>
        <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Close to PREMIS Representation (while Record Resource is close to PREMIS Intellectual Entity).
Distinguishing the message conveyed (Record Resource) and its physical representations allows to manage their descriptions in an efficient way, and to keep information about a Record Resource even when no physical representation of it exists any more, or is known. The relations between the distinct instantiations can then be expressed wherever these instantiations may be kept, and all these Instantiations can be related to the Record Resource they represent.</skos:scopeNote>

The method of human communication, either spoken or written by a

Language includes both spoken as well as written language, and
            thus the description of written language includes the script. Used in the description of
            a Record Resource to designate the language used in representing the information
            conveyed, and in the description of an Agent to designate the language used by the Agent
            to communicate. [Note, that the description any entity is also a Record, and thus
            Language is used in the description of description ]. Any given Record Resource may be
            represented in more than one Language, and any given Agent may use more than one
            language. Different Controlled Value Vocabularies for the names of languages are
            maintained by international bodies. For the description of cultural heritage resources,
            ISO 639-2, maintained by the Library of Congress, is widely used. ISO 639-2 includes a
            list of three-letter codes for each language, as well as the name of the language in
            English, French, and German. See
            https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php A Controlled Concept Vocabulary
            for names of scripts is maintained by The Unicode Consortium as ISO 15924. The list
            includes a four-letter code for each script, and the names of the script in English and

When the language of a Record Resource is written, or an Agent communicates using written language, then the Language Type designation (code or name) should be paired with a Script Type designation.

There is an ISO maintained Controlled Concept Groups for human languages (ISO 639-2: Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages).  ISO 639-2 includes a list of three-letter codes for each language, as well as the name of the language in English, French, and German. For obscure or rare languages, ISO 639-5: Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages Part 5: Alpha-3 code for language families and groups may be used to extend the range of languages covered.

A Mandate confers the authority or competencies of Agents to perform a specified Activity. 

In addition to assigning an Activity and delegating authority to perform the Activity to an Agent, a Mandate commonly limits the Place (jurisdiction) and Date (time period) within which an Agent may perform the Activity (where and when).

Mandates exist in a specific social and cultural context, and within that context are subject to change over time.

While a Mandate may be tacit, in whole or part, it may be explicitly expressed in a variety of documentary sources (for example, constitutions, legislation, (legal) acts, statutes, legal codes, ordinances, charges, charters, or mission statements).

The evidence for identifying a Mandate may be found in its entirety in one documentary source (for example, a law or regulation), or may be found in two or more sources. 

A Mandate should not be confused with the one or more documentary sources that serve as evidence of its identity.</skos:scopeNote>

Most commonly, a human being (biological person) has a single coeval social identity or persona. In everyday discourse, this is the “real person.”

Less common though not rare, over the course of a lifetime, personae in addition to the coeval (or “original”) persona may be associated with the human being. Such “alternative personae” are most often created by the original person for specific purposes. 

Under some circumstances, an alternative persona might eclipse or replace the original person (Mark Twain eclipsing Samuel Clemens; John Wayne eclipsing Marion Mitchell Morrison), that is, the social (shared) alternative identity becomes the predominate identity.

Less common yet is two or more persons collaborate to create a shared persona. Persona shared by two or more Persons constitute a kind of Group.

Within the archival context, the original Person generally will be the focus of the description, with alternative personae noted. Exceptionally, an alternative persona may displace the coeval persona. 

This entity includes:
- Historical or current people.
- People that manage records.</skos:scopeNote>

Position is the intersection of a Person and a Group.

Position exists independently of the Person that holds the position. 

More than one Person may hold a Position.

Position is commonly defined in a mandate, often called a position description or job description.  The mandate may specify the activity and competencies for performing the activity. 

A Position is often given a name.

A Position may be tied to a project or to a set of tasks and thus have a defined duration.

A Position may change over time, as the Group that establishes it changes over time.

Position is not to be confused with Occupation or Activity .

Within the Records created by a Corporate Body, a Position may be used to identify the Record Sets resulting from Activities performed by one or more Persons holding the Position over time, without necessarily identifying or describing the Person or Persons, or identifying which Records were created by each Person.</skos:scopeNote>

        <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">Individual records, sets of records, or parts of a record are
            all evidence of the activities of an Agent. More than one Agent may be involved in the
            creation of a Record Resource. The role of the Agent in creating the Record Resource may
            take different forms, for example, authoring of an individual record, accumulating a set
            of records, or forming a set of records. Though a Record, Record Set, and Record Part,
            under most circumstances, may be easily distinguished from one another, frequently
            identifying the boundary of each and how the “bounded information regions” interrelate,
            may present particular challenges. Documentary Forms provide the rules governing many
            Records, providing criteria for identifying its boundary, and identifying its essential
            Record Parts. Many Records, though, do not have well-established Documentary Forms,
            particularly electronic Records, where it may be difficult to determine, whether
            individual elements represented in separate bitstreams are Record Parts, or Records, or,
            indeed, Record Sets. For example, is a photograph represented independently in a
            bitstream embedded in a text document a Record, or a Record Part. Or is the same
            photograph attached to an email, maintaining its independent representation, a Record or
            a Record Part? A further challenge is presented when information is grouped for some
            purpose, for example, zip or tar “file compression” for saving storage space. One file
            comprises multiple bitstreams subjected to techniques that remove bits that can be
            losslessly recovered when decompressed. Under what circumstances is such a compressed
            bitstream a Record or Record Set? Determining when an information object is a Record,
            Record Part, or Record Set is based on perspective and judgement exercised in a
            particular context. In one context, the Agent describing an information object may
            designate it a Record, while another Agent in a different context may designate it a
            Record Part. Both designations are supported by RiC, and the significance of the
            difference for users of the Records is ameliorated by the fact that attributes and
            relations employed in describing each of the Record Entities are
            shared.</skos:scopeNote>

        <skos:scopeNote xml:lang="en">The Record members in a Record Set may physically reside
            together, though physical proximity is not essential. In a particular context, an Agent
            (e.g. administrator, records manager, archivist, end-user, etc.) may select the Record
            members of a Record Set based on a shared attribute or attributes, or a shared Relation
            or Relations. The grouping of the Records serves a purpose or purposes specific to the
            context of the Agent. Any shared attribute or relation, or combination of shared
            attributes or relations may designate the Record members in a Record Set. All Record
            members of a Record Set may share the attribute of having been accumulated by the same
            Agent, or all share the same Documentary Form and are created over time by the same
            Activity. A Record Set may represent the act of classifying the Records in accordance
            with a formal classification scheme that may be based on Activity (or Function or
            Process), subject, organizational structure, or other criteria; an act of archival
            arrangement (e.g. based on common provenance); or some other selection and grouping that
            fulfils a particular purpose or purposes (e.g. a classification that reflects or
            supports the purposes of a researcher). By exception, some Records are brought together
            based on their not belonging in the context of selection to other designated groups: a
            ‘Miscellaneous’ series for example. Record Set created by an Agent in the course of life
            or work Activity should be kept in a manner that preserves context and evidential value.
            Records Sets may also contain other Records Sets. Both a Record Set and a Record may
            simultaneously be a member of more than one Record Set, and over the course of its
            existence, a Record Set or Record may be a member of an indeterminate number of Record
            Sets in an indeterminate number of contexts. Record Sets and Records contained within a
            Record Set may be ordered into a sequence based on a common property or relation, or
            common properties or relations (e.g. alphabetical by Agent or related Place name);
            chronological order by an allocated Date; or some other criterion (e.g. an imposed order
            by relevance).</skos:scopeNote>
