# Diagrams

This is where you will find some diagrams that show some of the components of the RiC-O, for each version of RiC-O.
For now, as concerns RiC 1.0.1, you will just find there one diagram which provides a global overview of RiC-CM 1.0 entities and also shows a few relations.

The diagrams may, either display a part of RiC ontology itself, or illustrate how you can represent some real world cases using RiC-O. 

The diagrams have been drawn with [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/). Each folder contains the diagram in XML and renditions in JPEG. According to RiC these are two instantiations for each diagram!
